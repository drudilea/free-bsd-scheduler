## Git

The first installation method we’ll show uses the FreeBSD package index. This is generally the easiest and fastest way to install Git.

First, update the pkg repository index

```bash
pkg update -f
```

Next, download and install the git package.

```bash
pkg install git
```

You’ll need to enter **y** to confirm the installation. That’s it!

You can now move on to the Configuring Git section below to see some basic, useful customization options.
