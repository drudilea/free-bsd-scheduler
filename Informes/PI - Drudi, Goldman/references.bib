abstract = "Abstract Financial time series forecasting is a popular application of machine learning methods. Previous studies report that advanced forecasting methods predict price changes in financial markets with high accuracy and that profit can be made trading on these predictions. However, financial economists point to the informational efficiency of financial markets, which questions price predictability and opportunities for profitable trading. The objective of the paper is to resolve this contradiction. To this end, we undertake an extensive forecasting simulation, based on data from thirty-four financial indices over six years. These simulations confirm that the best machine learning methods produce more accurate forecasts than the best econometric methods. We also examine the methodological factors that impact the predictive accuracy of machine learning forecasting experiments. The results suggest that the predictability of a financial market and the feasibility of profitable model-based trading are significantly influenced by the maturity of the market, the forecasting method employed, the horizon for which it generates predictions and the methodology used to assess the model and simulate model-based trading. We also find evidence against the informational value of indicators from the field of technical analysis. Overall, we confirm that advanced forecasting methods can be used to predict price changes in some financial markets and we discuss whether these results question the prevailing view in the financial economics literature that financial markets are efficient.

abstract={Numerous stock market analysis methods have been proposed from simple moving average to the use of artificial intelligence such as neural networks and Bayesian networks. In this paper, we introduce a new concept and a methodology that enable predictability of asset price movement in the market by way of inference from the past data. We use schema to describe an economic instance, and a set of schema in time series to describe the flow of economic instances in the past. Within the schema, we introduce a concept of velocity and momentum to effectively characterize the dynamic nature of the market. We compare the current and the past instances to identify resemblance and take inference as a predictive capability of future asset price movement. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={We propose a method for collective sentiment analysis for stock market prediction and analyse its ability to predict the change of a stock price for the next day. The proposed method is a two-stage process, based on the latest natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. Our evaluation shows best performance with the SVM approach in sentiment detection, with accuracy rates of 71.84/74.3% for positive and negative sentiment, respectively. The results of sentiment analysis are used in predicting stock price movement (up or down), and we found that users' activity on Stock Twits overnight positively correlates with stock trading on the next business day. The collective sentiments in after hours have powerful prediction on the change of stock price for the next day in 9 out of 15 stocks studied by using the Granger Causality test. © 2014 IEEE.},
