abstract = "Abstract Financial time series forecasting is a popular application of machine learning methods. Previous studies report that advanced forecasting methods predict price changes in financial markets with high accuracy and that profit can be made trading on these predictions. However, financial economists point to the informational efficiency of financial markets, which questions price predictability and opportunities for profitable trading. The objective of the paper is to resolve this contradiction. To this end, we undertake an extensive forecasting simulation, based on data from thirty-four financial indices over six years. These simulations confirm that the best machine learning methods produce more accurate forecasts than the best econometric methods. We also examine the methodological factors that impact the predictive accuracy of machine learning forecasting experiments. The results suggest that the predictability of a financial market and the feasibility of profitable model-based trading are significantly influenced by the maturity of the market, the forecasting method employed, the horizon for which it generates predictions and the methodology used to assess the model and simulate model-based trading. We also find evidence against the informational value of indicators from the field of technical analysis. Overall, we confirm that advanced forecasting methods can be used to predict price changes in some financial markets and we discuss whether these results question the prevailing view in the financial economics literature that financial markets are efficient.

However, with the modernization of the financial transactions and the information systems, the large amount of information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of a financial asset. In the last decades, many researchers have attempted to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support the decision-making in different financial market segments. In the literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial market problems. However, only few studies have focused on review the literature of this topic. Most of the existing review articles have a limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a review of the application of several computational intelligent methods in several financial applications. This paper gives an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to 2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining financial text information, among others. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature of this field, (ii) the definition of a systematic procedure for guiding the task of building an intelligent trading system and (iii) a discussion about the main challenges and open problems in this scientific field.

To achieve this, we examine duration misperception in the horserace betting market. We develop a two-stage algorithm to predict horses’ winning probabilities that account for a duration-related factor that is known to affect horses’ winning prospects. The algorithm adapts survival analysis and combines it with the conditional logit model. Using a dataset of 4736 horseraces and the lifetime career statistics of the 53,295 horses running in these races, we demonstrate that prices fail to discount fully information related to duration since a horse's last win. We show that this failure is extremely costly, since a betting strategy based on the predictions arising from the model shows substantial profits (932.5 percent and 16.27 percent, with and without reinvestment of winnings, respectively). We discuss the important implications of duration neglect in the wider economy. "

Deciding the relevant input variables for these systems is a crucial factor and their performances depend a lot on the choice of input variables. In this work, a set of fifty-five technical indicators has been considered based on their application in technical analysis as input feature to predict the future (one-day-ahead) direction of stock indices. This study proposes four hybrid prediction models that are combinations of four different feature selection techniques (Linear Correlation (LC), Rank Correlation (RC), Regression Relief (RR) and Random Forest (RF)), with proximal support vector machine (PSVM) classifier. The performance of these models has been evaluated for twelve different stock indices, on the basis of several performance metrics used in literature. A new performance measuring criteria, called joint prediction error (JPE) is also proposed for comparing the results. The empirical results obtained over a set of stock market indices from different international markets show that all hybrid models perform better than the individual \{PSVM\} prediction model. The comparison between the proposed models demonstrates superiority of RF-PSVM over all other prediction models. Empirical findings also suggest the superiority of a certain set of indicators over other indicators in achieving better results. "

Many hidden factors contribute to these two subjects, which refer to the different kinds of operators (as fundamentalist and behaviourist), the different objectives amongst the retails, the institutional and business operators, the different time ranges and the different allocation plans. Moreover, the news effects on shortest time range, the induced sentiment and market movers play a key role in the modelling of the financial market. Two decision variables, named Energy E and Entropy S are introduced. Some specific values of these two variables act as attractors in the state space E-S; conesequently these two variables are useful for describing the price dynamics during the different market status (i.e. up trend, down trend, accumulation, and distribution). The result is a new decision framework, where the investor, the trader and the analyst may perform their prospects and forecasts. A multiparametric methodology for financial trading, investment and prospects analysis is defined and introduced, by following the Prospect Theory and by assuming the price fluctuations as a dynamical process in the stochastic context.

abstract = "Financial volatility refers to the intensity of the fluctuations in the expected return on an investment or the pricing of a financial asset due to market uncertainties. Hence, volatility modeling and forecasting is imperative to financial market investors, as such projections allow the investors to adjust their trading strategies in anticipation of the impending financial market movements. Following this, financial volatility trading is the capitalization of the uncertainties of the financial markets to realize investment profits in times of rising, falling and side-way market conditions. In this paper, an intelligent straddle trading system (framework) that consists of a volatility projection module (VPM) and a trade decision module (TDM) is proposed for financial volatility trading via the buying and selling of option straddles to help a human trader capitalizes on the underlying uncertainties of the Hong Kong stock market. Three different measures, namely: (1) the historical volatility (HV), (2) implied volatility (IV) and (3) model-based volatility (MV) of the Hang Seng Index (HSI) are employed to quantify the implicit volatility of the Hong Kong stock market. The \{TDM\} of the proposed straddle trading system combines the respective volatility measures with the well-established moving-averages convergence/divergence (MACD) principle to recommend trading actions to a human trader dealing in \{HSI\} straddles. However, the inherent limitation of the \{MACD\} trading rule is that it generates time-delayed trading signals due to the use of moving averages, which are essentially lagging trend indicators. This drawback is intuitively addressed in the proposed straddle trading system by applying the \{VPM\} to compute future projections of the volatility measures of the \{HSI\} prior to the activation of the TDM. The \{VPM\} is realized by a self-organising neural-fuzzy semantic network named the evolving fuzzy semantic memory (eFSM) model. As compared to existing statistical and computational intelligence based modeling techniques currently employed for financial volatility modeling and forecasting, eFSM possesses several desirable attributes such as: (1) an evolvable knowledge base to continuously address the non-stationary characteristics of the Hong Kong stock market; (2) highly formalized human-like information computations; and (3) a transparent structure that can be interpreted via a set of linguistic IF–THEN semantic fuzzy rules. These qualities provide added credence to the computed \{HSI\} volatility projections. The volatility modeling and forecasting performances of the eFSM, when benchmarked to several established modeling techniques, as well as the observed trading returns of the proposed straddle trading system, are encouraging.

The model aims to derive the aggregated measure for evaluating efficiency of the financial market and to find its interrelationships with the reversal of long-term trend. The radial basis function neural network was designed for forecasting moments of cardinal changes in stock market behavior, expressed by its entropy values derived from the symbolized time series of stock market index.

Further unlike the conventional \{TSK\} type fuzzy neural network the proposed model uses a functional link neural network (FLANN) in the consequent part of the fuzzy rules to provide an improved mapping. Moreover, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is suggested to solve the parameters estimation problem of Fuzzy Computationally Efficient \{EGARCH\} model. Being a parallel direct search algorithm, \{DE\} has the strength of finding global optimal solutions regardless of the initial values of its few control parameters. Furthermore, the \{DE\} based algorithm aims to achieve an optimal solution with a rapid convergence rate. The proposed model has been compared with some \{GARCH\} family models and hybrid fuzzy systems and \{GARCH\} models based on three performance metrics: MSFE, RMSFE, and MAFE. The results indicate that the proposed method offers significant improvements in volatility forecasting performance in comparison with all other specified models. "

Multi-order fuzzy time series (first-order, second-order and third-order) are applied in the proposed algorithm, and to improve the performance, genetic algorithm is used to find a good domain partition. Technical analysis such as the Rate of Change (ROC), Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), and Stochastic Oscillator (KDJ) are introduced to construct multi-variable fuzzy time series, and exponential smoothing is used to eliminate noise in the time series. In addition to the root mean square error and mean square error, the directional accuracy rate (DAR) is also used in our empirical studies. We apply the proposed method to forecast five well-known stock indexes and the NTD/USD exchange rates. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other existing models based on fuzzy time series. "

Simple trading rules are generated using two moving averages – a long period and a short period moving average, and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Selected technical indicators are used as features in defining predictive model based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs). A LS-SVM classifier has been used in order to predict trend of the stock indices’ value whereby the obtained outputs of the LS-SVM model are binary signals that can be used for defining the trading strategy. Comparing the results obtained from traditional statistical methods for predicting the trend of financial series and proposed LS-SVM model, it can be concluded that machine learning techniques capture the non-linear models which are dominant in the financial markets in more adequate way. Outperforming the results of Buy &amp; Hold strategy and technical trading strategies, application of LS-SVM in decision making process on investing on the financial market significantly can contribute to maximization of profitability on investment.

In this work, we propose a machine learning method to study the parameter space of a complex system, where the dynamics is coarsely characterized using topological invariants. We show that by using a nearest neighbor algorithm to sample the parameter space in a specific manner, we are able to predict with high accuracy the locations of critical transitions in parameter space.

The index is defined as the normalized energy variation and it can be used to study the behavior of stochastic time series, such as financial market daily data. Famous financial market crashes–Black Thursday (1929), Black Monday (1987) and the subprime crisis (2008)–are identified with clear and robust results.

abstract = "At local emerging stock markets such as Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, global institutional investors (GII) comprised of global mutual funds, offshore funds, and hedge funds play a key role and more often than not cause severe turmoil via massive selling. Thus, for the concerned local governments or private and institutional investors, it is quite necessary to monitor the behavior of \{GII\} against a sudden pullout. The main aim of this article is to propose an early warning system (EWS) which purposes issuing warning signal against the possible massive selling of \{GII\} at the local market. For this, we introduce machine learning algorithm which forecasts the behavior of \{GII\} by predicting future conditions. Technically, this \{EWS\} is an advanced form of the \{EWS\} developed by Oh et al. [Oh, K. J., Kim, T. Y., &amp; Kim, C. (2006). An early warning system for detection of financial crisis using financial market volatility. Expert Systems, 23, 83–98] which issues a warning based on classifying present conditions. This study is empirically done for the Korean stock market. "

For many years, many manifestations of \{TF\} such as a software program called Turtle Trader, for example, emerged in the industry. Surprisingly little has been studied in academic research about its algorithms and applications. Unlike financial forecasting, \{TF\} does not predict any market movement; instead it identifies a trend at early time of the day, and trades automatically afterwards by a pre-defined strategy regardless of the moving market directions during run time. Trend following trading has been popular among speculators. However it remains as a trading method where human judgment is applied in setting the rules (aka the strategy) manually. Subsequently the \{TF\} strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we evaluated and compared a collection of \{TF\} algorithms that can be programmed in a computer system for automated trading. In particular, a new version of \{TF\} called trend recalling model is presented. It works by partially matching the current market trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past. Our experiments based on real stock market data show that this method has an edge over the other trend following methods in profitability. The results show that \{TF\} however is still limited by market fluctuation (volatility), and the ability to identify trend signal. "

Daily market prices and financial technical indicators are utilized as inputs to predict the one day future closing price of individual stocks. The prediction of stock price movement is generally considered to be a challenging and important task for financial time series analysis. The accurate prediction of stock price movements could play an important role in helping investors improve stock returns. The complexity in predicting these trends lies in the inherent noise and volatility in daily stock price movement. The Bayesian regularized network assigns a probabilistic nature to the network weights, allowing the network to automatically and optimally penalize excessively complex models. The proposed technique reduces the potential for overfitting and overtraining, improving the prediction quality and generalization of the network. Experiments were performed with Microsoft Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. stock to determine the effectiveness of the model. The results indicate that the proposed model performs as well as the more advanced models without the need for preprocessing of data, seasonality testing, or cycle analysis. "

We examine this question using Euro-area yield curves for AAA-rated and AAA-with-other bonds. Investors’ conditional forecasts about the yield curves for different assets, at various forecasting horizons, are modeled using a \{VAR\} model with time-varying parameters. Two processes are assumed for the evolution of these parameters: a constant-gain learning model and a new endogenous learning technique proposed here. Both these algorithms allow investors to account for structural changes in the data. The endogenous learning mechanism also allows investors to compensate for large deviations in observed coefficients used for forecasting, relative to past data. Daily data is used to estimate the gain parameters for the learning algorithms, and we find that these gains vary across asset types, implying investors form conditional expectations differently for assets with differential risks. For 2005–2015, the investors’ conditional forecasts for the AAA-rated bonds are better described using the endogenous learning mechanism, implying that investors with lower risk preferences are more sensitive to large deviations in the data.

While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. "

abstract = "Abstract For many years, how to make stock market predictions has been a prevalent research topic. To carry out accurate forecasting, stock analysts and academic researchers have tried various analysis techniques, algorithms, and models. For example, "technical analysis” is a popular approach used by common stock investors to analyze market trend, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GAs), neural network (NN), and fuzzy time-series (FTS), were proposed by researchers to forecast the future stock index. Although the daily forecasts are very useful for professional investors who implement intraday trading, we argue that forecasting a bullish turning point is a more interesting issue than the future stock index for common investor because an accurate forecast will bring a huge amount of stock return. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent pattern recognition model, based on two new stock pattern recognition methods, “PIP bull-flag pattern matching” and the “floating-weighted bull-flag template,” to recognize a bull-flag stock pattern. The bull-flag pattern is a stock's turning point with proper timing, which can enable a stock investor to profit. To promote recognition accuracy, the proposed model employs chart patterns and technical indicators, simultaneously, as pattern recognition factors. In the model verification, we evaluate the proposed model with stock returns by forecasting two stock databases (TAIEX and NASDAQ), and comparing the returns with other advanced algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the published algorithms, such as rough set theory (RST), genetic algorithms (GAs) and their hybrid model, and gives a high-level of profitability. Additionally, the trading strategies, provided by the proposed model, also help investors to make beneficial investment decisions in the stock market. "

To do so, we consider, in addition to the set of variables used in Rapach and Zhou (2013), the forecasting ability of four other important variables: the \{US\} economic policy uncertainty, the equity market uncertainty, the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment, and the Kansas City Fed’s financial stress index. Using a more recent dataset compared to that of Rapach and Zhou (2013), our results from predictive regressions show that the newly added variables do not play any significant statistical role in explaining the equity premium relative to the historical average benchmark over the out-of-sample horizon, even though they are believed to possess valuable informative content about the state of the economy and financial markets. Interestingly, however, barring the economic policy uncertainty index, the three other indexes considered in this study yield economically significant out-of-sample gains, especially during recessions, when compared to the historical benchmark.

In this paper, a hybrid v-SVR model is developed and combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and brain storm optimization (BSO) for stock price index forecasting. Correlation analysis and \{PCA\} are conducted initially to select the input variables of the v-SVR from 20 technical indicators, while the advanced \{BSO\} algorithm is used to search for optimal parameters of v-SVR. Case studies of the China Securities Index 300 (CSI300) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index (SZSE Component Index) are examined as illustrative examples to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed hybrid forecast strategy. Numerical results indicate that the developed hybrid model is not only simple but also able to satisfactorily approximate the actual \{CSI300stock\} price index, and it can be an effective tool in stock market mining and analysis.

The objective is to examine whether using the recent relevant variables leads to additional improvements in stock return forecasting. Given evidence of non-linearity in the financial market, the resulting variables are then provided to neural networks, including probabilistic and feed-forward neural networks, for predicting the directions of future excess stock return. The results show that redeveloped neural network models that use the recent relevant variables generate higher profits with lower risks than the buy-and-hold strategy, conventional linear regression, and the random walk model, as well as the neural network models that use constant relevant variables.

Unfortunately, many of these studies fail to consider alternative forecasting techniques, the relevance of input variables, or the performance of the models when using different trading strategies. This paper introduces an information gain technique used in machine learning for data mining to evaluate the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. Neural network models for level estimation and classification are then examined for their ability to provide an effective forecast of future values. A cross-validation technique is also employed to improve the generalization ability of several models. The results show that the trading strategies guided by the classification models generate higher risk-adjusted profits than the buy-and-hold strategy, as well as those guided by the level-estimation based forecasts of the neural network and linear regression models.

abstract = "Abstract In this study a Multi-Objective Evolutionary System is used to predict the future tendency of assets price. Therefore, a framework using a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) in its core to optimize a set of Trading or Investment Strategies (TSs) was developed. The investigated framework is used to determine potential buy, sell or hold conditions in stock markets, aiming to yield high returns at a minimal risk. The Volatility Index (VIX), indicators based on the \{VIX\} and other Technical Indicators (TI) are optimized to find the best investment strategy. Additionally, fair and established metrics are used to evaluate both the return and the linked risk of the optimized TSs. Furthermore, these strategies are evaluated in several markets using data from the main stock indexes of the most developed economies, such as: NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, \{FTSE\} 100, \{DAX\} 30, and also \{NIKKEI\} 225. The achieved results clearly outperform both the Buy&amp;Hold and Sell&amp;Hold. Additionally, the Pareto-Fronts obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show the inherent trade-off between risk and return in financial. In this paper the option of using an adaptive approach was chosen, which led to the development of a framework able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed framework is able to evolve a set of \{TSs\} suitable for the diverse profiles of investors from the most risky to the most careful with interesting results, which suggests great potential in the framework generalization capabilities. The use of the \{VIX\} enables the system to increase the stock return compared to traditional Technical Indicators by avoiding losses when the stress in the stock market increases. The \{GA\} enables the system to adapt to different types of markets. The algorithm achieves a return of higher than 10% annual for the period of 2006–2014 in the \{NASDAQ\} and \{DAX\} indexes, in a period that includes the stock market crash of 2008. "

We focus on U.S. equity premium forecastability and illustrate key issues via an empirical application based on updated data. Some studies argue that, despite extensive in-sample evidence of equity premium predictability, popular predictors from the literature fail to outperform the simple historical average benchmark forecast in out-of-sample tests. Recent studies, however, provide improved forecasting strategies that deliver statistically and economically significant out-of-sample gains relative to the historical average benchmark. These strategies – including economically motivated model restrictions, forecast combination, diffusion indices, and regime shifts – improve forecasting performance by addressing the substantial model uncertainty and parameter instability surrounding the data-generating process for stock returns. In addition to the U.S. equity premium, we succinctly survey out-of-sample evidence supporting U.S. cross-sectional and international stock return forecastability. The significant evidence of stock return forecastability worldwide has important implications for the development of both asset pricing models and investment management strategies. "

Like in conventional ex-post analysis based on estimated entropy, high entropy values characterize unpredictable series, while more stable series exhibit lower entropy values. We first evaluate (by theory and simulation) the performance of our method in terms of mean and variance of the predictions. Then, we apply our technique to several sets of historical financial data, correlating the entropy trend to contemporary socio-political events. The efficiency of our technique for application to financial engineering analysis is shown in comparison with the conventional approximate entropy method (usually applied in econometrics). "

Both volume and prices are driven by underlying economic forces, and thus convey important information about the workings of the market. This chapter focuses on the empirical characteristics of prices and volume in stock markets. The interactions between prices and quantities in an equilibrium yield a rich set of implications for any asset pricing model, when an explicit link between economic fundamentals and the dynamic properties of asset returns and volume are derived. By exploiting the relation between prices and volume in the dynamic equilibrium model, one can identify and construct the hedging portfolio, which can be used by all investors to hedge against changes in market conditions. This hedging portfolio has considerable forecast power in predicting future returns of the market portfolio and its abilities to explain cross-sectional variation in expected returns is comparable to other popular risk factors such as market betas, the Fama and French \{SMB\} factor, and optimal forecast portfolios. The presence of market frictions, such as transactions costs, can influence the level of trading volume and serve as a bridge between the market microstructure literature and the broader equilibrium asset pricing literature.

A general model allows for endogenously determined changes in variance while the more restrictive model forces the variance to follow the same process throughout the sample period.

The asymmetric error statistics penalize models for under- or over-predicting volatility.

To test the predictive power of candlestick patterns on short-term price movement, we propose the definition of daily average return to alleviate the impact of correlation among stocks’ overlap-time returns in statistical tests. To show the robustness of our result, two methods of trend definition are used for both the medium-market-value and large-market-value sample sets. We use Step-SPA test to correct for data snooping bias. Statistical results show that the predictive power differs from pattern to pattern, three of the eight patterns provide both short-term and relatively long-term prediction, another one pair only provide significant forecasting power within very short-term period, while the rest three patterns present contradictory results for different market value groups. For all the four pairs, the predictive power drops as predicting time increases, and forecasting power is stronger for stocks with medium market value than those with large market value. "

Liquidity together with book-to-market equity explains cross-sectional returns. Furthermore, the well-documented value premium is explained by a liquidity-augmented Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and the result is robust in the presence of distress factors and a battery of macroeconomic variables. This suggests that liquidity could be a useful component in forecasting expected returns. The ability of liquidity in explaining value premium is robust to the financial distress factor and a number of macroeconomic variables. The liquidity premium of liquid over illiquid stocks is statistically significant even after being adjusted by the mimicking size factor (SMB), mimicking value/growth factor (HML), distress factor and momentum.

abstract = "Many studies have demonstrated that back-propagation neural network can be effectively used to uncover the nonlinearity in the financial markets. Unfortunately, back-propagation algorithm suffers the problems of slow convergence, inefficiency, and lack of robustness. This paper introduces a multi-stage optimization approach (MSOA) used in back-propagation algorithm for training neural network to forecast the Chinese food grain price. We divide the training sample of neural network into two parts considering the truth that the recent observations is more important than the older ones. Firstly, we use the first training sample to train the neural network and achieve the network structure. Secondly, we continue to use the second training sample to further optimize the structure of neural network based on the previous step. Empirical results show that \{MSOA\} overcomes the weakness of conventional \{BP\} algorithm to some extend. Furthermore the neural network based on \{MSOA\} can improve the forecasting performance significantly in terms of the error and directional evaluation measurements. The paper also proves accurate price estimation may not be a good predictor of the direction of change in the price levels in food market. The neural network based on \{MSOA\} can be used as an alternative forecasting method for future Chinese food price forecasting. "

In contrast, we propose the use of a tailored reinforcement learning method, since it can conquer learning task of arbitrary length. We then perform a thorough comparison with a two-pronged evaluation. First, we compare the predictive performance using a manually-labeled dataset. Here, reinforcement learning outperforms common approaches from the related literature, leading to a balanced classification accuracy of up to 70.17%. Second, we examine how detecting negation scopes can improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis for financial news, leading to an improvement of up to 10.63% in the correlation between news sentiment and stock market returns. This reveals negation scope detection as a crucial leverage in decision support from sentiment. "

abstract = "Abstract Stock trend prediction is regarded as one of the most challenging tasks of financial time series prediction. Conventional statistical modeling techniques are not adequate for stock trend forecasting because of the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the stock market. With this regard, many machine learning approaches are used to improve the prediction results. These approaches mainly focus on two aspects: regression problem of the stock price and prediction problem of the turning points of stock price. In this paper, we concentrate on the evaluation of the current trend of stock price and the prediction of the change orientation of the stock price in future. Then, a new approach named status box method is proposed. Different from the prediction issue of the turning points, the status box method packages some stock points into three categories of boxes which indicate different stock status. And then, some machine learning techniques are used to classify these boxes so as to measure whether the states of each box coincides with the stock price trend and forecast the stock price trend based on the states of the box. These results would support us to make buying or selling strategies. Comparing with the turning points prediction that only considered the features of one day, each status box contains a certain amount of points which represent the stock price trend in a certain period of time. So, the status box reflects more information of stock market. To solve the classification problem of the status box, a special features construction approach is presented. Moreover, a new ensemble method integrated with the AdaBoost algorithm, probabilistic support vector machine (PSVM), and genetic algorithm (GA) is constructed to perform the status boxes classification. To verify the applicability and superiority of the proposed methods, 20 shares chosen from Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and 16 shares from National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) are applied to perform stock trend prediction. The results show that the status box method not only have the better classification accuracy but also effectively solve the unbalance problem of the stock turning points classification. In addition, the new ensemble classifier achieves preferable profitability in simulation of stock investment and remarkably improves the classification performance compared with the approach that only uses the \{PSVM\} or back-propagation artificial neural network (BPN).

The majority of those algorithms focus on improving the predictive performance and assume that model update is always desired as soon as possible and as frequently as possible. In this study we consider potential model update as an investment decision, which, as in the financial markets, should be taken only if a certain return on investment is expected. We introduce and motivate a new research problem for data streams – cost-sensitive adaptation. We propose a reference framework for analyzing adaptation strategies in terms of costs and benefits. Our framework allows us to characterize and decompose the costs of model updates, and to asses and interpret the gains in performance due to model adaptation for a given learning algorithm on a given prediction task. Our proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates how the framework can aid in analyzing and managing adaptation decisions in the chemical industry. "

abstract = "Publisher Summary Volatility modeling and forecasting have attracted much attention in recent years, largely motivated by its importance in financial markets. Many asset-pricing models use volatility estimates as a simple risk measure, and volatility appears in option pricing formulas derived from such models. For hedging against risk and for portfolio management, reliable volatility estimates and forecasts are crucial. To account for different stylized facts, several types of models are available such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models, stochastic volatility (SV) models, regime switching models, and threshold models. One of the important shortcomings of the ARMA-type models is the assumption of constant variance. Most financial data exhibit changes in volatility, and this feature of the data cannot by captured under this assumption. An important property of \{ARCH\} models is their ability to capture volatility clustering in financial data. The idea behind the regime switching model is that the data that show changes in the regime will repeat themselves in the future. Therefore one can predict future states by using the parameter estimates from past observations. Stochastic variance or stochastic volatility models lead to the generalizations of the well-known Black–Scholes results in finance theory, in addition to many other applications. "

Previously, many researchers have long used statistical methods for handling the related problems of investment markets. However, these conventional methods become more complex when relationships in the input/output dataset are nonlinear. Nevertheless, statistical techniques always rely on the assumptions on linear separability, multivariate normality, and independence of the predictive variables; unfortunately, many of the common models of treating the financial markets problems violate these assumptions. Therefore, to reconcile the existing shortcomings, this study offers three hybrid models based on a rough sets classifier to extract decision rules and aid making investment decision for the market investors. The proposed hybrid models include three differently integrated models for solving \{IPO\} (Initial Public Offerings) returns problems of the financial markets: (1) Experiential Knowledge (EK) + Feature Selection Method (FSM) + Minimize Entropy Principle Approach (MEPA) + Rough Set Theory (RST) + Rule Filter (RF), (2) \{EK\} + Decision Trees (DT)-C4.5 + \{RST\} + RF, and (3) \{EK\} + \{FSM\} + \{RST\} + RF. The proposed hybrid models are illustrated by examining an \{IPO\} dataset for publicly traded firms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid models outperform the listing methods in accuracy, number of attributes, standard deviation, and number of rules. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid models generate comprehensible rules readily applied in knowledge-based systems for investors. Meaningfully, the study findings and implications are of value to both academicians and practitioners. "

While the return distribution used in the traditional theories of asset pricing and portfolio selection is the normal distribution, numerous studies that have investigated the empirical behavior of asset returns in financial markets throughout the world reject the hypothesis that asset return distributions are normally distribution. Alternative models for describing return distributions have been proposed since the 1960s, with the strongest empirical and theoretical support being provided for the family of stable distributions (with the normal distribution being a special case of this distribution). Since the turn of the century, specific forms of the stable distribution have been proposed and tested that better fit the observed behavior of historical return distributions. More specifically, subclasses of the tempered stable distribution have been proposed. In this paper, we propose one such subclass of the tempered stable distribution which we refer to as the “KR distribution”. We empirically test this distribution as well as two other recently proposed subclasses of the tempered stable distribution: the Carr–Geman–Madan–Yor (CGMY) distribution and the modified tempered stable (MTS) distribution. The advantage of the \{KR\} distribution over the other two distributions is that it has more flexible tail parameters. For these three subclasses of the tempered stable distribution, which are infinitely divisible and have exponential moments for some neighborhood of zero, we generate the exponential Lévy market models induced from them. We then construct a new \{GARCH\} model with the infinitely divisible distributed innovation and three subclasses of that \{GARCH\} model that incorporates three observed properties of asset returns: volatility clustering, fat tails, and skewness. We formulate the algorithm to find the risk-neutral return processes for those \{GARCH\} models using the “change of measure” for the tempered stable distributions. To compare the performance of those exponential Lévy models and the \{GARCH\} models, we report the results of the parameters estimated for the S&amp;P 500 index and investigate the out-of-sample forecasting performance for those \{GARCH\} models for the S&amp;P 500 option prices.

A recent stream of literature on behavioral finance has revealed that boundedly rational agents using simple rules of thumb for their decisions under uncertainty provides a more realistic description of human behavior than perfect rationality with optimal decision rules. Consequently, the application of technical analysis in trading could produce high returns. Machine learning techniques have been employed in economic systems in modeling nonlinearities and simulating human behavior. In this study, we expand the literature that evaluates return sign forecasting ability by introducing a recurrent neural network approach that combines heuristic learning and short-term memory emulation, thus mimicking the decision-making process of boundedly rational agents. We investigate the relative direction-of-change predictability of the neural network structure implied by the Lee–White–Granger test as well as compare it to other well-established models for the \{DJIA\} index. Moreover, we examine the relationship between stock return volatility and returns. Overall, the proposed model presents high profitability, in particular during “bear” market periods. "

An attempt has been made to investigate whether the power of the collective sentiments of StockTwits might be predicted and how the changes in these predicted sentiments inform decisions on whether to sell, buy or hold the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index. In this paper, a filter approach of feature selection is first employed to identify the most relevant terms in tweet postings. The decision tree (DT) model is then built to determine the trading decisions of those terms or, more importantly, combinations of terms based on how they interact. Then a trading strategy based on a predetermined investment hypothesis is constructed to evaluate the profitability of the term trading decisions extracted from the \{DT\} model. The experiment results based on 122-tweet term trading (TTT) strategies achieve a promising performance and the (TTT) strategies dramatically outperform random investment strategies. Our findings also confirm that StockTwits postings contain valuable information and lead trading activities in capital markets. "

However, a limitation arises from all these techniques and is known as the random walk dilemma (RWD).

In this paper, we propose a suitable model inspired by concepts in mathematical morphology (MM) and lattice theory (LT). This model is generically called the increasing morphological perceptron (IMP). Also, we present a gradient steepest descent method to design the proposed \{IMP\} based on ideas from the back-propagation (BP) algorithm and using a systematic approach to overcome the problem of non-differentiability of morphological operations. Into the learning process we have included a procedure to overcome the RWD, which is an automatic correction step that is geared toward eliminating time phase distortions that occur in stock market phenomena. Furthermore, an experimental analysis is conducted with the \{IMP\} using four complex non-linear problems of time series forecasting from the Brazilian stock market. Additionally, two natural phenomena time series are used to assess forecasting performance of the proposed \{IMP\} with other non financial time series. At the end, the obtained results are discussed and compared to results found using models recently proposed in the literature. "

This novel combination of feature selection not only takes advantage of \{ICA\} optimization swiftness, but also the \{ANFIS\} prediction accuracy. The emitted buy and sell signals of the model revealed that Signal databases approach gets better results with 87% prediction accuracy and the wrapper features selection obtains 12% improvement in predictive performance regarding to the base study. In addition, since the wrapper-based feature selection models are considerably more time-consuming, our presented wrapper ANFIS-ICA algorithm's results have superiority in time decreasing as well as increasing prediction accuracy as compared to other algorithms such as wrapper Genetic algorithm (GA).

In this model, a promising data mining technique in machine learning has been proposed to uncover the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. We suppose that the investors decide their investment positions by analyzing the historical data on the stock market, and the historical data are given weights depending on their time, in detail, the nearer the time of the historical data is to the present, the stronger impact the data have on the predictive model, and we also introduce the Brownian motion in order to make the model have the effect of random movement while maintaining the original trend.

That's why determining the exact movements of stock market price is considerably regarded. However, complex and uncertain behaviors of stock market make exact determination impossible and hence strong forecasting models are deeply desirable for investors' financial decision making process. This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of using technical indicators, such as simple moving average of close price, momentum close price, etc. in Turkish stock market. To capture the relationship between the technical indicators and the stock market for the period under investigation, hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, which consist in exploiting capabilities of Harmony Search (HS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are used for selecting the most relevant technical indicators. In addition, this study simultaneously searches the most appropriate number of hidden neurons in hidden layer and in this respect; proposed models mitigate well-known problem of overfitting/underfitting of ANN. The comparison for each proposed model is done in four viewpoints: loss functions, return from investment analysis, buy and hold analysis, and graphical analysis. According to the statistical and financial performance of these models, \{HS\} based \{ANN\} model is found as a dominant model for stock market forecasting. "

This strategy is then applied to prediction of \{FOREX\} market. Financial markets, such as FOREX, are generally attractive applications of \{FTS\} due to their poorly understood model as well as their great deal of uncertainty in terms of quote fluctuations and the behaviours of the humans in the loop. Specifically, since the \{FOREX\} market can exhibit different behaviours at different times, the adaptive order selection is executed online to find the best order of the \{FTS\} for current prediction. The order selection module uses voting, statistical analytic and emotional decision making agents. Comparison of the proposed method with earlier studies demonstrates improved prediction accuracy at similar computation cost. "

Conventional single objective optimization based adaptive prediction models reported in the literature do not satisfy many cost functions simultaneously. Very few reported materials are available on the development of multiobjective optimization based stock market prediction models. In this paper multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version-II (NSGA-II) have been introduced to effectively train the adaptive stock market prediction models which simultaneously optimize four performance measures. The model developed is an adaptive one with nonlinearity introduced at the input end by Legendre polynomial expansion scheme. The stepwise algorithms are provided to develop the model and simulation study is carried to evaluate the performance. To arrive at the best possible solutions from these models, fuzzy logic based decision making strategy is suggested. Close examination of simulation results reveals that in terms of directional accuracy (DA) and computation time \{MOPSO\} based model is better where as in terms of average relative variance (ARV) and I-metric the NSGA-II model is superior. However, with regard to mean average percentage of error (MAPE) and Theli’s U, \{MOPSO\} is better above one month ahead prediction. But for below one month ahead prediction, the NSGA-II model is preferable. To facilitate comparison two single objective optimization based models (PSO and \{GA\} based) are also developed and the performance has been obtained through simulation study. Comparison of the results demonstrate that in terms of \{MAPE\} and \{DA\} the performance of multiobjective is better where as the single objective optimization model exhibit superior performance in terms of Theli’s U and the ARV.

The producer and consumer periodically feed their trading agents with supply and demand (S&amp;D) forecasts. We suggested a parameterizable trading strategy, called bands and frequencies, for the agents.

The proposed model denoted as IT2F-CE-EGARCH helps to enhance the ability of \{EGARCH\} model through a joint estimation of the important features of \{EGARCH\} like leverage effect, asymmetric shock by leverage effect with the secondary membership functions of interval type2 \{TSK\} \{FLS\} and the functional expansion and learning component of a CEFLANN. The secondary membership functions with upper and lower limits of \{IT2FLS\} provide a forecasting interval for handling more complicated uncertainties involved in volatility forecasting compared to type1 FLS. The performance of the proposed model has been observed with two membership functions i.e. Gaussian with fixed mean, uncertain variance and Gaussian with fixed variance and uncertain mean. The proposed model has also been compared with a few other fuzzy time series models and \{GARCH\} family models based on four performance metrics: MSFE, RMSFE, \{MAFE\} and Rel MAE. Again a differential harmony search (DHS) algorithm has been suggested for optimizing the parameters of all the fuzzy time series models. The results indicate that the proposed IT2F-CE-EGARCH model offers significant improvements in volatility forecasting performance in comparison with all other specified models over \{BSE\} Sensex and \{CNX\} Nifty dataset.

This study seeks to identify factors important for forecasting changes in stock prices in Poland. The paper examines the relationships between common stock returns and four well-recognized factors: size, value, momentum and liquidity. First, we review existing literature in the field. Second, we investigate the relationship between fundamental factors and stock returns in the Polish market. We study also interactions between separate factors. We perform a long/short portfolio analysis based on all stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange between 2000 and 2012. We find that historically in Poland it was possible to build factor-based portfolios which outperformed the broad market. However, the Polish market seems too young to derive some significant statistical interference. "

The analysis is based on discrete wavelet decomposition on different time scales. This technique allows to analyze the relationship between different time horizons, since the short-term ones (2 to 4 days) up to the long-term ones (64 to 128 days). The results indicate that there is a negative or null relationship between systemic risk and returns for Brazil from 2004 to 2007. As the average excess return of a market portfolio in relation to a risk-free asset during that period was positive, it would be expected this relationship to be positive. That is, higher systematic risk should result in higher excess returns, which did not occur. Therefore, during that period, appropriate compensation for systemic risk was not observed in the Brazilian market. The scales that proved to be most significant to the risk-return relation were the first three, which corresponded to short-term time horizons. When treating differently, year-by-year, and consequently separating positive and negative premiums, some relevance is found, during some years, in the risk/return relation predicted by the CAPM. However, this pattern did not persist throughout the years. Therefore, there is not any evidence strong enough confirming that the asset pricing follows the model. "

Advancement in computer technology has allowed many recent studies to utilize machine learning techniques such as neural networks and decision trees to predict stock returns. In the area of machine learning, classifier ensembles (i.e. combining multiple classifiers) have proven to be a method superior to single classifiers. In order to build a better model for predicting stock returns effectively and efficiently, this study aims at investigating the prediction performance that utilizes the classifier ensembles method to analyze stock returns. In particular, the hybrid methods of majority voting and bagging are considered. Moreover, performance using two types of classifier ensembles is compared with those using single baseline classifiers (i.e. neural networks, decision trees, and logistic regression). These two types of ensembles are ‘homogeneous’ classifier ensembles (e.g. an ensemble of neural networks) and ‘heterogeneous’ classifier ensembles (e.g. an ensemble of neural networks, decision trees and logistic regression). Average prediction accuracy, Type I and \{II\} errors, and return on investment of these models are also examined. Our results indicate that multiple classifiers outperform single classifiers in terms of prediction accuracy and returns on investment. In addition, heterogeneous classifier ensembles offer slightly better performance than the homogeneous ones. However, there is no significant difference between majority voting and bagging in prediction accuracy, but the former has better stock returns prediction accuracy than the latter. Finally, the homogeneous multiple classifiers using neural networks by majority voting perform best when predicting stock returns. "

Although the rules optimized by GA/GP reportedly obtain a profit in out-of-sample testing periods, it is hard to believe that they yield a profit in distant out-of-sample periods. In this paper, we first consider a framework where we optimize the parameters of the trading rule in an in-sample training period, and then execute trades according to the rule in its succeeding out-of-sample period. We experimentally show that the framework very often results in a profit. We then consider a framework in which we conduct optimization as above and then execute trades in distant out-of-sample periods. We empirically show that the results depend on the similarity of the trends in the training and testing periods. "

In this paper, a forecasting model based on chaotic mapping, firefly algorithm, and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to predict stock market price. The forecasting model has three stages. In the first stage, a delay coordinate embedding method is used to reconstruct unseen phase space dynamics. In the second stage, a chaotic firefly algorithm is employed to optimize \{SVR\} hyperparameters. Finally in the third stage, the optimized \{SVR\} is used to forecast stock market price. The significance of the proposed algorithm is 3-fold. First, it integrates both chaos theory and the firefly algorithm to optimize \{SVR\} hyperparameters, whereas previous studies employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize these parameters. Second, it uses a delay coordinate embedding method to reconstruct phase space dynamics. Third, it has high prediction accuracy due to its implementation of structural risk minimization (SRM). To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed algorithm, we selected the three most challenging stock market time series data from \{NASDAQ\} historical quotes, namely Intel, National Bank shares and Microsoft daily closed (last) stock price, and applied the proposed algorithm to these data. Compared with genetic algorithm-based \{SVR\} (SVR-GA), chaotic genetic algorithm-based \{SVR\} (SVR-CGA), firefly-based \{SVR\} (SVR-FA), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), the proposed model performs best based on two error measures, namely mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE).

We answer this question for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) stock markets. Empirically, we test the occurrence of structural breaks in the \{GCC\} return data using the Inclan and Tiao (1994)’s algorithm and we check the relevance of \{LM\} using Shimotsu (2006) procedure before estimating the ARFIMA-FIGARCH and ARFIMA-FIAPARCH models with different innovations’ distributions and computing VaR and ES. Our results show that all the \{GCC\} market's volatilities exhibit significant structural breaks matching mainly with the 2008–2009 global financial crises and the Arab spring. Also, they are governed by \{LM\} process either in the mean or in the conditional variance which cannot be due to the occurrence of structural breaks. Furthermore, the forecasting ability analysis shows that the \{FIAPARCH\} model under skewed Student-t distribution turn out to improve substantially the VaR and the \{ES\} forecasts. "

Although, professional stock analysts and fund managers usually make subjective judgments, based on objective technical indicators, it is difficult for non-professionals to apply this forecasting technique because there are too many complex technical indicators to be considered. Moreover, two drawbacks have been found in many of the past forecasting models: (1) statistical assumptions about variables are required for time series models, such as the autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH), to produce forecasting models of mathematical equations, and these are not easily understood by stock investors; and (2) the rules mined from some artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as neural networks (NN), are not easily realized. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a hybrid forecasting model, using multi-technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Further, it includes four proposed procedures in the hybrid model to provide efficient rules for forecasting, which are evolved from the extracted rules with high support value, by using the toolset based on rough sets theory (RST): (1) select the essential technical indicators, which are highly related to the future stock price, from the popular indicators based on a correlation matrix; (2) use the cumulative probability distribution approach (CDPA) and minimize the entropy principle approach (MEPA) to partition technical indicator value and daily price fluctuation into linguistic values, based on the characteristics of the data distribution; (3) employ a \{RST\} algorithm to extract linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset; and (4) utilize genetic algorithms (GAs) to refine the extracted rules to get better forecasting accuracy and stock return. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with two types of performance evaluations, accuracy and stock return, and by using a six-year period of the \{TAIEX\} (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) as the experiment dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is superior to the two listed forecasting models (RST and GAs) in terms of accuracy, and the stock return evaluations have revealed that the profits produced by the proposed model are higher than the three listed models (Buy-and-Hold, \{RST\} and GAs).

These systems are open, they interchange information or mass with environment and constantly modify their internal structure and patterns of activity in the process of self-organization. As a result, they are flexible and easily adapt to variable external conditions. However, the most striking property of such systems is the existence of emergent phenomena which cannot be simply derived or predicted solely from the knowledge of the systems’ structure and the interactions among their individual elements. This property points to the holistic approaches which require giving parallel descriptions of the same system on different levels of its organization. There is strong evidence–consolidated also in the present review–that different, even apparently disparate complex systems can have astonishingly similar characteristics both in their structure and in their behaviour. One can thus expect the existence of some common, universal laws that govern their properties. Physics methodology proves helpful in addressing many of the related issues. In this review, we advocate some of the computational methods which in our opinion are especially fruitful in extracting information on selected–but at the same time most representative–complex systems like human brain, financial markets and natural language, from the time series representing the observables associated with these systems. The properties we focus on comprise the collective effects and their coexistence with noise, long-range interactions, the interplay between determinism and flexibility in evolution, scale invariance, criticality, multifractality and hierarchical structure. The methods described either originate from “hard” physics–like the random matrix theory–and then were transmitted to other fields of science via the field of complex systems research, or they originated elsewhere but turned out to be very useful also in physics — like, for example, fractal geometry. Further methods discussed borrow from the formalism of complex networks, from the theory of critical phenomena and from nonextensive statistical mechanics. Each of these methods is helpful in analyses of specific aspects of complexity and all of them are mutually complementary. "

Rather, we find evidence that investor sentiment is positively affected by prior stock price performance. We also find no significant evidence that investor sentiment from Internet postings has predictive power for volatility and trading volume.

Therefore, individual investors, stock fund managers, and financial analysts attempt to predict price fluctuation in stock markets by either linear model or MATI. From literatures, three major drawbacks are found in many existing forecasting models. First, forecasting rules mined from some \{AI\} algorithms, such as neural networks, could be very difficult to understand. Second, statistic assumptions about variables are required for time series to generate forecasting models, which are not easily understandable by stock investors. Third, stock market investors usually make short-term decisions based on recent price fluctuations, i.e., the last one or two periods, but most time series models use only the last period of stock price. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this study proposes a hybrid forecasting model using linear model and \{MATI\} to predict stock price trends with the following four steps: (1) test the lag period of Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and calculate the last n-period moving average; (2) use subtractive clustering to partition technical indicator values into linguistic values based on data discretization method objectively; (3) employ fuzzy inference system (FIS) to build linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset, and optimize the \{FIS\} parameters by adaptive network; and (4) refine the proposed model by adaptive expectation models. The proposed model is then verified by root mean squared error (RMSE), and a ten-year period of \{TAIEX\} is selected as experiment datasets. The results show that the proposed model is superior to the other forecasting models, namely Chen's model and Yu's model in terms of RMSE. "

Subsequently, the obtained optimal lengths are applied to generate a new fuzzy time series, proposed in this study, named exponential fuzzy time series. In this final phase, due to the nature of exponential fuzzy time series, another round of optimization is required to estimate certain method parameters. Finally, this model is used for future forecasts. In order to validate the proposed hybrid method, forty-six case studies from five stock index databases are employed and the findings are compared with well-known fuzzy time series models and classic methods for time series. The proposed model has outperformed its counterparts in terms of accuracy. "

In addition, when new trading points are created, the structure and parameters of the \{TS\} model are constantly inherited and updated. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed \{TS\} fuzzy rule-based modeling approach, we have acquired the stock trading data in the \{US\} stock market. The \{TS\} fuzzy approach with dynamic threshold control is compared with a conventional linear regression model and artificial neural networks.

In verification, this paper employs seven year period of \{TAIEX\} stock index, from 1997 to 2003, as experimental datasets, and the root mean square error (RMSE) as evaluation criterion. The performance comparison results show that the proposed model outperforms the listing methods in forecasting Taiwan stock market. Besides, from statistical test results, it is showed that the volatility of Dow Jones and the \{NASDAQ\} affect \{TAIEX\} significantly. "

In this three stage method, through a comprehensive investigation all possible features which can be effective on stocks risk and return are identified. Then, in the next stage risk and return are predicted by applying data mining techniques for the given features. Finally, we develop a hybrid algorithm, on the basis of filter and function-based clustering; the important features in risk and return prediction are selected then risk and return re-predicted. The results show that the proposed hybrid model is a proper tool for effective feature selection and these features are good indicators for the prediction of risk and return. To illustrate the approach as well as to train data and test, we apply it to Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) data from 2002 to 2011. "

It gives consideration to periods before and after the recent global financial crisis (GFC). To this end, the bivariate DCC-FIAPARCH model, the modified \{ICSS\} algorithm and the Value-at-Risk (VaR) are employed to capture volatility spillovers, detect potential structural breaks and assess the portfolio market risks. Using the U.S. and the \{BRICS\} daily spot market indices for the period from September 1997 to October 2013, our empirical results show strong evidence of asymmetry and long memory in the conditional volatility and significant dynamic correlations between the U.S. and the \{BRICS\} stock markets. Moreover, we find several sudden changes in these markets with a common break date centered on September 15, 2008 which corresponds to the Lehman Brothers collapse. The Brazil, India, China and South Africa markets are strongly affected by the GFC, supporting the hypothesis of recoupling (with increased linkages). In contrast, the hypothesis of decoupling is supported for the Russian stock markets only. Finally, the skewed Student-t \{FIAPARCH\} models outperform and provide more accurate in-sample estimates and out-of-sample forecasts of VaR than the normal and Student-t \{FIAPARCH\} models in almost all cases. These results provide helpful information to financial risk managers, regulators and portfolio investors to determine the diversification benefits among these markets. "

  abstract     = {Abstract Technical analysis is one of the useful forecasting methods to predict the future stock prices. For professional stock analysts and fund managers, how to select necessary technical indicators to forecast stock trends is important. Traditionally, stock analysts have used linear time series models for stock forecasting. However, the results would be in doubt when the forecasting problems are nonlinear. Further, stock market investors usually make short-term decisions based on recent price fluctuations, but most time series models only use the last period of stock prices in forecasting. In this paper, the proposed hybrid model utilizes an adaptive expectation genetic algorithm to optimize adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for predicting stock price trends, and four proposed procedures are included in the hybrid model for forecasting: (1) select essential technical indicators from popular indicators by a cited paper (Cheng et al., 2010); (2) use subtractive clustering to partition technical indicator values into linguistic values based on an objective data discretization method; (3) employ fuzzy inference system (FIS) to build linguistic rules from the linguistic technical indicator dataset and optimize the \{FIS\} parameters by adaptive network; and (4) refine the proposed model using the adaptive expectation model, which optimizes parameter by genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified with performance evaluations and root mean squared error (RMSE), and a 6-year period of \{TAIEX\} (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index) is selected as the experimental datasets. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model is superior to the three listing forecasting models (Chen's model, Yu's model, and Cheng et al.'s model) in terms of RMSE. },

A successful stock buying/selling generally occurs near price trend turning point. Thus the prediction of stock market indices and its analysis are important to ascertain whether the next day's closing price would increase or decrease. This paper, therefore, presents a simple \{IIR\} filter based dynamic neural network (DNN) and an innovative optimized adaptive unscented Kalman filter for forecasting stock price indices of four different Indian stocks, namely the Bombay stock exchange (BSE), the \{IBM\} stock market, \{RIL\} stock market, and Oracle stock market. The weights of the dynamic neural information system are adjusted by four different learning strategies that include gradient calculation, unscented Kalman filter (UKF), differential evolution (DE), and a hybrid technique (DEUKF) by alternately executing the \{DE\} and \{UKF\} for a few generations. To improve the performance of both the \{UKF\} and \{DE\} algorithms, adaptation of certain parameters in both these algorithms has been presented in this paper. After predicting the stock price indices one day to one week ahead time horizon, the stock market trend has been analyzed using several important technical indicators like the moving average (MA), stochastic oscillators like K and D parameters, WMS%R (William indicator), etc. Extensive computer simulations are carried out with the four learning strategies for prediction of stock indices and the up or down trends of the indices. From the results it is observed that significant accuracy is achieved using the hybrid \{DEUKF\} algorithm in comparison to others that include only DE, UKF, and gradient descent technique in chronological order. Comparisons with some of the widely used neural networks (NNs) are also presented in the paper. "

The promise of effectively mining big data is nothing less than achieving a higher level of understanding in nearly every facet of life, from climate change to the complex patterns in financial markets, to the complexity of living systems. The life sciences stand poised to lead in both the generation of big data and the realization of dramatic benefit from it, whether predicting and preventing the next big outbreak or uncovering the best ways to treat, prevent, and cure common human diseases. We can now score variations in \{DNA\} across whole genomes; \{RNA\} levels and alternative isoforms, metabolite levels, protein levels and protein state information across the transcriptome, metabolome and proteome; methylation status across the methylome; and construct extensive protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction maps, all in a comprehensive fashion and at the scale of populations of individuals. Interactions among these molecular entities define the complex web of biological processes that give rise to all higher-order phenotypes, including disease. The development of analytical approaches that simultaneously integrate different dimensions of data is essential if we are to extract meaning from these large-scale data to elucidate the complexity of living systems. In this chapter I describe a number of analytical approaches aimed at inferring causal relationships among variables in very large-scale datasets by leveraging \{DNA\} variation as a systematic perturbation source. The causal inference procedures are also demonstrated to enhance the ability to reconstruct truly predictive, probabilistic causal gene networks that reflect the biological processes underlying complex phenotypes such as disease. By integrating many different dimensions of data simultaneously to construct these networks, I detail examples of how to construct and then apply network models to uncover causal relationships among molecular phenotypes like gene expression and between molecular and high-order traits such as disease.

The investor generally makes his portfolio decision according to his experience and his economic wisdom. So, deterministic portfolio selection is not a good choice for the investor. In most of the recent works on this problem, fuzzy set theory is widely used to model the problem in uncertain environments. This paper utilizes the concept of interval numbers in fuzzy set theory to extend the classical mean–variance (MV) portfolio selection model into mean–variance–skewness (MVS) model with consideration of transaction cost. In addition, some other criteria like short and long term returns, liquidity, dividends, number of assets in the portfolio and the maximum and minimum allowable capital invested in stocks of any selected company are considered. Three different models have been proposed by defining the future financial market optimistically, pessimistically and in the combined form to model the fuzzy \{MVS\} portfolio selection problem. In order to solve the models, fuzzy simulation (FS) and elitist genetic algorithm (EGA) are integrated to produce a more powerful and effective hybrid intelligence algorithm (HIA). Finally, our approaches are tested on a set of stock data from Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). "

The underlying motivation for using \{ACRO\} is the ability to overcome the issues of convergence, parameter setting and overfitting and to accurately forecast financial time series data even when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear. Historical data of seven different stock indices have been collected for 15 years to test the performance of the \{ACRNN\} approach.

abstract = "Abstract Accurate prediction of stock market returns is a very challenging task because of the highly nonlinear nature of the financial time series. In this study, we apply an artificial neural network (ANN) that can map any nonlinear function without a prior assumption to predict the return of the Japanese Nikkei 225 index. (1) To improve the effectiveness of prediction algorithms, we propose a new set of input variables for \{ANN\} models. (2) To verify the prediction ability of the selected input variables, we predict returns for the Nikkei 225 index using the classical back propagation (BP) learning algorithm. (3) Global search techniques, i.e., a genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), are employed to improve the prediction accuracy of the \{ANN\} and overcome the local convergence problem of the \{BP\} algorithm. It is observed through empirical experiments that the selected input variables were effective to predict stock market returns. A hybrid approach based on \{GA\} and \{SA\} improve prediction accuracy significantly and outperform the traditional \{BP\} training algorithm. "

In all cases, Gulf equity markets receive volatility from the oil market but only in the case of Saudi Arabia we found a significant volatility spillover from the Saudi market to the oil market. Our results are important for building accurate asset pricing models, forecasting future equity and oil price return volatility, and will further our understanding of the interaction of the stock markets of Gulf countries vis-à-vis the \{US\} equity market and the global oil market.

The exponential smoothing model (ESM), autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) can be used to make forecasts based on time series. In this paper, a hybrid approach combining ESM, ARIMA, and \{BPNN\} is proposed to be the most advantageous of all three models. The weight of the proposed hybrid model (PHM) is determined by genetic algorithm (GA). The closing of the Shenzhen Integrated Index (SZII) and opening of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIAI) are used as illustrative examples to evaluate the performances of the PHM. Numerical results show that the proposed model outperforms all traditional models, including ESM, ARIMA, BPNN, the equal weight hybrid model (EWH), and the random walk model (RWM). "

It is inspired on Takens Theorem and consists of an intelligent hybrid model composed of a Modular Morphological Neural Network (MMNN) combined with a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA), which searches for the particular time lags capable of a fine tuned characterization of the time series and estimates the initial (sub-optimal) parameters (weights, architecture and number of modules) of the MMNN. Each individual of the \{MGA\} population is trained by the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm to further improve the \{MMNN\} parameters supplied by the MGA. After adjusting the model, it performs a behavioral statistical test and a phase fix procedure to adjust time phase distortions observed in financial time series. Furthermore, an experimental analysis is conducted with the proposed model using four real world stock market time series. Five well-known performance metrics and an evaluation function are used to assess the performance of the proposed model and the obtained results are compared to classical models presented in literature.

After taking into consideration the margin-based transaction cost, the simulated trading indicates that a long or short straddle 15 days before the options’ final settlement day based on the 60-day in-sample-period volatility forecasting recruiting market turnover achieves the best average monthly return of 15.84%. This study bridges the gap between option trading, market volatility, and the signal of the investors’ overreaction through the simulation of the option trading strategy. The trading algorithm based on the volatility forecasting recruiting investor sentiment could be further applied in electronic trading and other artificial intelligence decision support systems. "

This paper compares the predictive performance of the conditional country risk and the conditional residual risk in forecasting the direction of change in the return on the \{UK\} stock market index. The conditional country risk and the conditional residual risk are estimated using the bivariate BEKK-GARCH technique and the direction of change in the \{UK\} stock market index is modelled using the binary logit approach. Both the in-sample and the out-of-sample predictions suggest that, as a predictor, the conditional residual risk is superior to the conditional country risk. Our findings support the residual risk model while contradicting the traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Moreover, our tactical asset allocation simulations show that when the conditional residual risk is used in conjunction with multiple-threshold trading strategies to guide the investment decisions, the actively managed portfolio achieves greater returns than the return on a buy and hold portfolio.

The forecasting activity results from the interaction of a population of experts, each integrating genetic and neural technologies. An expert of this kind embodies a genetic classifier designed to control the activation of a feedforward artificial neural network for performing a locally scoped forecasting activity. Genetic and neural components are supplied with different information: The former deal with inputs encoding information retrieved from technical analysis, whereas the latter process other relevant inputs, in particular past stock prices. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach in response to real data, a stock market forecasting system has been implemented and tested on two stock market indexes, allowing for account realistic trading commissions. The results pointed to the good forecasting capability of the approach, which repeatedly outperformed the “Buy and Hold” strategy. "

Most organizations fail to recognize the need for diverse specialization within architecture because they fail to understand the depth of complexity and the costs associated with mediocrity within each area of specialization. They also believe that a general practioner, which we will call a solution architect, is qualified and appropriate to address the complexities across a wide array of technology areas. In reality, this is equivalent to staffing a medical center primarily with general practioners that act as the specialists. A healthy organization maintains top specialists with which the general practioners can participate in getting expertise that is in alignment with a future state vision that reduces complexity and costs.

The proposed Translation Invariant Morphological Robust Automatic phase-Adjustment (TIMRAA) method consists of a hybrid intelligent model composed of a Modular Morphological Neural Network (MMNN) with a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QIEA), which searches for the best time lags to reconstruct the phase space of the time series generator phenomenon and determines the initial (sub-optimal) parameters of the MMNN. Each individual of the \{QIEA\} population is further trained by the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm to improve the \{MMNN\} parameters supplied by the QIEA. Also, for each prediction model generated, it uses a behavioral statistical test and a phase fix procedure to adjust time phase distortions observed in stock market time series. Furthermore, an experimental analysis is conducted with the proposed method through four Brazilian stock market time series, and the achieved results are discussed and compared to results found with random walk models and the previously introduced Time-delay Added Evolutionary Forecasting (TAEF) and Morphological-Rank-Linear Time-lag Added Evolutionary Forecasting (MRLTAEF) methods.},

In this paper, an adaptive Fuzzy-GARCH model with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to solve this problem. The adaptive Fuzzy-GARCH model refers to both \{GARCH\} models and the parameters of membership functions, which are determined by the characteristics of market itself. Here, we present an iterative algorithm based on \{PSO\} to estimate the parameters of the membership functions. The \{PSO\} method aims to achieve a global optimal solution with a rapid convergence rate. The three stock markets of Taiwan, Japan, and Germany were analyzed to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. "

For the latter component, we specify the commonly used simple mixture model such that the component is the cumulative sum of a process which is 0 with some probability (1 − α) and is a random variable with probability α. Our estimation method transforms such a model into a linear state space with mixture of normal innovations, so that an extension of Kalman filter algorithm can be applied. We apply this random level shift model to the logarithm of daily absolute returns for the S&amp;P 500, AMEX, Dow Jones and \{NASDAQ\} stock market return indices. Our point estimates imply few level shifts for all series. But once these are taken into account, there is little evidence of serial correlation in the remaining noise and, hence, no evidence of long-memory. Once the estimated shifts are introduced to a standard \{GARCH\} model applied to the returns series, any evidence of \{GARCH\} effects disappears. We also produce rolling out-of-sample forecasts of squared returns. In most cases, our simple random level shift model clearly outperforms a standard GARCH(1,1) model and, in many cases, it also provides better forecasts than a fractionally integrated \{GARCH\} model.

Therefore, in this class of series, there is a slow decay of the autocorrelation function as the time difference increases. Many practical forecasting problems fall in this class, for instance, in financial time series, hydrology and earth sciences applications. This research introduces a hybrid method combining Auto Regressive Fractional Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) models and Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) for the forecast of long memory (long-range) time series. The proposed method is developed as one algorithm consisting of two phases. The first phase is related to the autoregressive part of the model, while the second phase is related to the Moving Average part. Based on these ideas, the combined \{ARFIMA\} and \{FTS\} model is introduced. For the parameter estimation of the model, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is selected, based on its performance on similar optimization problems. In order to illustrate the benefit and potential of the proposed ARFIMA–FTS method, it has been applied to the two stock index databases, namely Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX)and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), together with exchange rate data of nine main currencies versus USD. Based on the reported results, it is possible to conclude the superiority of the proposed hybrid method, compared with classical \{ARFIMA\} models and other methods in the literature. "

This paper presents an algorithm, \{PXtract\} to automate the recognition process of possible irregularities underlying the time series of stock data.

This model allows for dynamic changes in the degree of market integration, regional market risk premium, regional exchange-rate risk premium, and domestic market risk premium. Our findings show several interesting facts. First, the time-varying degree of integration in the Singapore market is satisfactorily explained by the level of trade openness and the term premium of \{US\} interest rates, which have recently tended to increase, however these markets remain substantially segmented from the world market. Second, the local market risk premium is found to explain a significant proportion of the total risk premium for emerging market returns. Our findings illustrate several important implications for portfolio hedgers for making optimal portfolio allocations, engaging in risk management and forecasting future volatility in equity markets. Our results are also of interest for both policymakers and investors, with respect to regional development policies and dedicated portfolio investment strategies in the ASEAN-5 region. "

A state-independent pricing model overestimates the cost of equity by about 4% per annum for a utility firm and by as much as 3% for industries. We also observe that the expected return, volatility, risk loading, and pricing error all display state-dependent dynamics that coincide with the business cycle. More interestingly, the forecasted market and Fama–French factor risk premiums can predict the future real \{GDP\} growth rate even though the model does not use any macroeconomic variables, which suggests that the proposed Bayesian framework captures the state-dependent dynamics well.

To resolve the aforementioned concern, this study proposed a new approach by combining the variable consistency dominance-based rough set approach (VC-DRSA) with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to explore the complex relationship among financial variables and improve future performances. In addition, a fuzzy inference system was devised on the basis of the findings of the VC-DRSA and \{DEMATEL\} technique to examine granulized knowledge and implications. A group of real \{IT\} companies listed on the Taiwan stock market were used as an empirical case to present the benefits of the new approach. The results generated a set of decision rules that can be used for forecasting future performance prospects and diagnosing the directional influences of crucial variables to gain insights; certain strong decision rules were further examined using fuzzy inference to verify the obtained implications. The findings contribute to the financial applications of decision-making science and computational intelligence in practice. "

As for contagion in volatility, the lead/lag relationships appear to be multidirectional among Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan, but between Hong Kong and Singapore, and between Hong Kong and Taiwan, they are unidirectional, with Hong Kong playing the dominant role in generating negative volatility shocks. In addition, the conditional \{ICAPM\} with asymmetric multivariate general autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic in mean (MGARCH(1,1)-M) structure is able to explain/predict on average 17.28% of the return variations in those markets. Therefore, this study provide a further evidence that the time-varying risk premium is a very strong candidate in explaining the predictable excess return puzzle [Lewis, K. K. (1994). Puzzles in international financial markets. \{NBER\} Working Paper No. 4951] since the risk premia founded in this article are not only statistically significant but also economically significant. "

Integrating these two sources of data not only enriches the information available for the forecasting model, but it can potentially capture joint patterns that may not otherwise be identified when each data source is employed separately. We start with market data and then gradually add various textual data representations, going from simple representations, such as word counts, to more advanced representations involving sentiment analysis. To find the incremental value of each data representation, we build an end-to-end recommendation process including data preprocessing, modeling, validation, trade recommendations and economic evaluation. Each component of the modeling process is optimized to remove human bias and to allow us to impartially compare the results of the various models. Additionally, we experiment with several forecasting algorithms to find the one that yields the “best” results according to a variety of performance criteria. We employ data representation procedures and modeling improvements beyond those used in previous related studies. The economic evaluation of the results is conducted using a simulation procedure that inherently accounts for transaction costs and eliminates biases that have potentially affected previous related data-mining studies. This research is one of the largest-scale data-mining studies for evaluating the effectiveness of integrating market data with textual news data for the purpose of stock investment recommendations. The results of our study are promising in that they show that augmenting market data with advanced textual data representation significantly improves stock purchase decisions. Best results are achieved when the approach is implemented with a nonlinear neural network forecasting algorithm. "

An additional optimization is performed with each particle of the \{PSO\} population (a distinct MMNN) using the back-propagation (BP) algorithm. After the \{MMNN\} parameters adjustment, we use a behavioral statistical test and a phase fix procedure to adjust time phase distortions observed in financial time series. Finally, we conduct an experimental analysis with the proposed method using four real world stock market time series, where five well-known performance metrics and a fitness function are used to assess the prediction performance.

The well-known GJR–GARCH form models the volatility process, capturing the leverage effect. To capture potential skewness and heavy tails, the model assumes an asymmetric Laplace form as the conditional distribution of the series. Furthermore, dynamics in higher moments are modeled by allowing the shape parameter in this distribution to be time-varying. Estimation is via an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme, employing the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm with a mixture of Gaussian proposal distributions. A simulation study highlights accurate estimation and improved inference compared to a single-Gaussian-proposal \{MH\} method. The model is illustrated by applying it to four international stock market indices and two exchange rates, generating one-step-ahead forecasts of VaR and ES. Standard and non-standard tests are applied to these forecasts, and the finding is that the proposed model performs favourably compared to some popular competitors: in particular it is the only conservative model of risk over the period studied, which includes the recent global financial crisis.

However, many of these techniques rely on the peculiar characteristics of a specific type of data to detect the outliers. As a result, they cannot be easily applied to different types of data in other application domains; they should at least be tuned and customized to adapt to the new domain. They also may need certain amount of training data to build their models. This makes them hard to apply especially when only a limited amount of data is available. The work described in this paper tackle the problem by proposing a graph-based approach for the discovery of contextual outliers in sequential data. The developed algorithm offers a higher degree of flexibility and requires less amount of information about the nature of the analyzed data compared to the previous approaches described in the literature. In order to validate our approach, we conducted experiments on stock market and weather data; we compared the results with the results from our previous work. Our analysis of the results demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper is successful and effective in detecting outliers in data from different domains, one financial and the other meteorological.

We find that value-growth characteristics generally provide better explanations for long-term stock returns than past performance. The evidence also shows that winners identified by capital gains dominate past performance winners in predicting reversals in the cross-sectional comparison. However, in the time-series analysis, when returns on capital gain winners are adjusted by the Fama and French (1996) risk factors, the predictive power of capital gain winners disappears. Our results show that capital gain winners are heavily featured as growth stocks. Return reversals in capital gain winners potentially reflect market price corrections for growth stocks. We conclude that investors’ incentives to delay paying capital gain taxes cannot fully rationalise long-term reversals in the \{UK\} market. Our results also imply that the long-term return pattern potentially reflects a mixture of investor rational and irrational behaviour. "

The forecast data is then reduced using a GM(1,N) model, clustered using a K-means clustering algorithm and then supplied to a \{RS\} classification module which selects appropriate investment stocks by applying a set of decision-making rules. Finally, a grey relational analysis technique is employed to specify an appropriate weighting of the selected stocks such that the portfolio’s rate of return is maximized. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated using electronic stock data extracted from the financial database maintained by the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ). The predictive ability and portfolio results obtained using the proposed hybrid model are compared with those of a GM(1,1) prediction method. It is found that the hybrid method not only has a greater forecasting accuracy than the GM(1,1) method, but also yields a greater rate of return on the selected stocks. "

For the case of stock market crashes, we develop an algorithm that predicts the next crash within a certain time interval after the previous one. We show that this algorithm outperforms random prediction. The efficiency of our algorithm sets up a lower bound of efficiency for effective prediction of stock market crashes. "

We allow for time-varying risk aversion (via external habit formation) and time-varying persistence and volatility in the stochastic process for rent growth, consistent with the U.S. data for the period 1960 to 2013. Under fully-rational expectations, the model significantly underpredicts the volatility of the U.S. price–rent ratio for reasonable levels of risk aversion. We demonstrate that the model can approximately match the volatility of the price–rent ratio in the data if near-rational agents continually update their estimates for the mean, persistence and volatility of fundamental rent growth using only recent data (i.e., the past 4 years), or if agents employ a simple moving-average forecast rule for the price–rent ratio that places a large weight on the most recent observation. These two versions of the model can be distinguished by their predictions for the correlation between expected future returns on housing and the price–rent ratio. Only the moving-average model predicts a positive correlation such that agents tend to expect high future returns when prices are high relative to fundamentals—a feature that is consistent with a wide variety of survey evidence from real estate and stock markets.

That is, hidden Markov chain can be utilized to better describe the stock return dynamics when moving averages are correlated. Based on the MS-MA model, a recursive method of \{EM\} algorithm for parameter estimation is proposed and a numerical analysis is demonstrated. Furthermore, we empirically test the hidden Markov chain model using Dow Jones thirty stocks' data. The empirical results show that the dynamic process of stock returns exhibits MS-MA property, meaning the moving averages of stock returns are correlated. Therefore, the MS-MA model allows us to better understand and to predict stock return stochastic process. This model also helps in pricing equity derivatives. "

This paper employs wrapper approach to select the optimal feature subset from original feature set composed of 23 technical indices and then uses voting scheme that combines different classification algorithms to predict the trend in Korea and Taiwan stock markets. Experimental result shows that wrapper approach can achieve better performance than the commonly used feature filters, such as χ2-Statistic, Information gain, ReliefF, Symmetrical uncertainty and CFS. Moreover, the proposed voting scheme outperforms single classifier such as SVM, kth nearest neighbor, back-propagation neural network, decision tree, and logistic regression. "

Second, the market (covariance) price of risk must be economically plausible as an estimate of the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA). We apply our \{ICAPM\} criteria to eight popular multifactor models and the results show that most models do not satisfy the \{ICAPM\} restrictions. Specifically, the “hedging” risk prices have the wrong sign and the estimates of \{RRA\} are not economically plausible.

The \{VPRS\} model is then combined with a moving Average Autoregressive Exogenous (ARX) prediction model and Grey Systems theory to create an automatic stock market forecasting and portfolio selection mechanism. In the proposed mechanism, financial data are collected automatically every quarter and are input to an \{ARX\} prediction model to forecast the future trends of the collected data over the next quarter or half-year period. The forecast data are then reduced using a GM(1, N) model, classified using a \{FCM\} clustering algorithm, and then supplied to a \{VPRS\} classification module which selects appropriate investment stocks in accordance with a pre-determined set of decision-making rules. Finally, a grey relational analysis technique is employed to weight the selected stocks in such a way as to maximize the rate of return of the stock portfolio. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated using electronic stock data extracted from the financial database maintained by the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ). The portfolio results obtained using the proposed hybrid model are compared with those obtained using a Rough Set (RS) selection model. The effects of the number of attributes of the \{RS\} lower approximation set and \{VPRS\} β-lower approximation set on the classification are systematically examined and compared. Overall, the results show that the proposed stock forecasting and stock selection mechanism not only yields a greater number of selected stocks in the β-lower approximation set than in the \{RS\} approximation set, but also yields a greater rate of return.

Although the dividend forecasting is of importance in the real world for the purpose of investment and financing decision, it is not easy for us to find good theoretical models which can predict future dividends accurately except Marsh and Merton [Marsh, T.

Photovoltaic and solar thermal are the main sources of electricity generation from solar energy.

These plants can work like a conventional power plant and compete in the energy stock market avoiding intermittence in electricity production. This work presents a comparisons of statistical models based on time series applied to predict half daily values of global solar irradiance with a temporal horizon of 3 days. Half daily values consist of accumulated hourly global solar irradiance from solar raise to solar noon and from noon until dawn for each day. The dataset of ground solar radiation used belongs to stations of Spanish National Weather Service (AEMet). The models tested are autoregressive, neural networks and fuzzy logic models. Due to the fact that half daily solar irradiance time series is non-stationary, it has been necessary to transform it to two new stationary variables (clearness index and lost component) which are used as input of the predictive models. Improvement in terms of \{RMSD\} of the models essayed is compared against the model based on persistence. The validation process shows that all models essayed improve persistence. The best approach to forecast half daily values of solar irradiance is neural network models with lost component as input, except Lerida station where models based on clearness index have less uncertainty because this magnitude has a linear behaviour and it is easier to simulate by models.

In recent years, clustering all companies in the stock markets based on their similarities in the shape of the stock market has increasingly become a common scheme. However, existing approaches are impractical because the stock price data are high-dimensional data and the changes in the stock price usually occur with shift, which makes the categorization more complex. Moreover, no stock market categorization method that can cluster companies down to the sub-cluster level, which are very meaningful to end users, has been developed. Therefore, in this paper, a novel three-phase clustering model is proposed to categorize companies based on the similarity in the shape of their stock markets. First, low-resolution time series data are used to approximately categorize companies. Then, in the second phase, pre-clustered companies are split into some pure sub-clusters. Finally, sub-clusters are merged in the third phase. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using various published data sets in different domains. We show that this approach has good performance in efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing conventional clustering algorithms. "

A genetic algorithm is utilized to find the best mixture of neural networks, the topology of individual networks in the ensemble, and to determine the features set. The genetic algorithm also determines the window size of the input time-series supplied to the individual classifiers in the mixture of experts. The mixtures of neural network experts consist of recurrent back-propagation networks, and radial basis function networks. The application of genetic algorithm on the heterogeneous mixture of powerful neural network architectures shows promise for prediction of stock market time series. These highly non-linear, stochastic and highly non-stationary time series have been found to be notoriously difficult to predict using conventional linear statistical methods. In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired methodology to tackle such hard problem using a multi-faceted solution. "

In this study, we developed a trading model using a modified \{RSI\} using trend-removed stock data. The model has several parameters including, the trend detection period, \{RSI\} buy-sell trigger levels and periods. These parameters are optimized using genetic algorithms; then the trading performance is compared against B&amp;H and standard \{RSI\} indicator usage. 9 different \{ETFs\} are selected for evaluating trading performance. The results indicate there is a performance improvement both in profit and success rates using this new model. As future work, other indicators might be modelled in a similar fashion in order to see if it is possible to find one indicator that can work under any market condition. "

The network is modeled including the first order Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) type fuzzy if then rules with two types of feedback loops. The recurrent structure in the proposed model comes from locally feeding the firing strength of the fuzzy rule back to itself and by including a few time delay components at the output layer. The novelty of the model is based on the fact that the internal temporal feedback loops and time delayed output feedback loops are used for further enhancing the prediction capability of traditional neuro-fuzzy system in handling more dynamic financial time series data. Another recurrent functional link artificial neural network (RCEFLANN) model is also presented for a comparative study. In the second part of the paper a modified differential harmony search (MDHS) technique is proposed for estimating the parameters of the model including the antecedent, consequent and feedback loop parameters. Experimental results obtained by implementing the model on two different stock market indices demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to existing models for stock price prediction.

Extensive researches have resulted in numerous financial applications using \{AI\} models. Since stock investment is a major investment activity, Lack of accurate information and comprehensive knowledge would result in some certain loss of investment. Hence, stock market prediction has always been a subject of interest for most investors and professional analysts. Stock market prediction is a challenging problem because uncertainties are always involved in the market movements. This paper proposes a hybrid intelligent model for stock exchange index prediction. The proposed model is a combination of data preprocessing methods, genetic algorithms and Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm for learning feed forward neural networks. Actually it evolves neural network initial weights for tuning with \{LM\} algorithm by using genetic algorithm. We also use data pre-processing methods such as data transformation and input variables selection for improving the accuracy of the model. The capability of the proposed method is tested by applying it for predicting some stock exchange indices used in the literature. The results show that the proposed approach is able to cope with the fluctuations of stock market values and also yields good prediction accuracy. So it can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find data patterns while performing financial prediction. "

In the review Fama describes increasingly fine information that is useful in organizing the discussion. It is mentioned that weak-form predictability uses the information in past stock prices. Semi-strong form predictability uses variables that are publicly available, and strong form uses anything else. The weak-form predictability (using the information in past stock prices) is more fragile and less compelling than the semi-strong form predictability (using publicly available information more generally). Further, the review highlights the issue of predictability in stock returns, which has important and broad economic implications relating to the efficiency of capital markets in allocating resources to their highest valued uses. The discussion concludes with conditional asset pricing models, which provided a rich setting for the study of the dynamic behavior of asset markets. Conditional Performance Evaluation is the application of these models to the problem of evaluating the performance of portfolio managers. Models that allow for time-varying conditional moments produce different inferences about performance thanthe traditional measures that do not allow for predictability, and have influenced both academic views and professional investment practice. It mentions that research on predictability has stimulated numerous advances in the statistical and econometric methods of financial economics and is likely to continue. "

To illustrate the capability of MISMIS, we have evaluated strategies of trading the future options of Hang Seng Index (HSI). We find that historical HSI, Dow Jones Index, property price index, retailing sales figure, prime lending rate, and consumer price index in Hong Kong are essential factors affecting the performance of the trading of HSI’s future option. Also there are some feedbacks from the in-depth interviews of six financial consultant upon how they perceived the prototype MISMIS. "

We aimed to develop a real-time monitoring system that could promptly identify the start, and accurately predict the end, of the winter surge in a paediatric intensive care (PIC) setting. We adapted a statistical process control method from the stock market called “Bollinger bands” that compares current levels of demand for \{PIC\} services to thresholds based on the medium term average demand. Algorithms to identify the start and end of the surge were developed for a specific \{PIC\} service: the North Thames Children's Acute Transport Service (CATS) using eight winters of data (2005–12) to tune the algorithms and one winter to test the final method (2013/14). The optimal Bollinger band thresholds were 1.2 and 1 standard deviations above and below a 41-day moving average of demand respectively. A simple linear model was found to predict the end of the surge and overall demand volume as soon as the start had been identified. Applying the method to the validation winter of 2013/14 showed excellent performance, with the surge identified from 18th November 2013 to 4th January 2014. An Excel tool running the algorithms has been in use within \{CATS\} since September 2014. There were three factors which facilitated the successful implementation of this tool: the perceived problem was pressing and identified by the clinical team; there was close clinical engagement throughout and substantial effort was made to develop an easy-to-use Excel tool for sustainable use.

So it is widely acknowledged that stock price series modeling and forecasting is a challenging work. A significant amount of work has been done in this field, and in them, soft computing techniques have showed good performance. Generally most of these works can be divided into two categories. One is to predict the future trend or price; another is to construct decision support system which can give certain buy/sell signals. In this paper, we propose a new intelligent trading system based on oscillation box prediction by combining stock box theory and support vector machine algorithm. The box theory believes a successful stock buying/selling generally occurs when the price effectively breaks out the original oscillation box into another new box. In the system, two \{SVM\} estimators are first utilized to make forecasts of the upper bound and lower bound of the price oscillation box. Then a trading strategy based on the two bound forecasts is constructed to make trading decisions. In the experiment, we test the system on different stock movement patterns, i.e. bull, bear and fluctuant market, and investigate the training of the system and the choice of the time span of the price box. The experiments on 442 S&amp;P500 components show a promising performance is achieved and the system dramatically outperforms buy-and-hold strategy. "

Mean excess returns on \{NYSE\} stocks in October through March account for 78–107% of their annual means and reflect a seasonal asymmetric return reversal tendency, which in turn explains low long-horizon variance ratios. Both market losses in April through September and subsequent returns in October through March are related, but with opposing signs, to October through March economic activity.

The proposed asset allocation strategy, called meta policy (MP), is designed to utilize the temporal information from both stock recommendations and the ratio of the stock fund over the asset. Local traders are constructed with pattern-based multiple predictors, and used to decide the purchase money per recommendation. Formulating the \{MP\} in the reinforcement learning framework is achieved by a compact design of the environment and the learning agent.

In relation to the Euro-Area stock markets, we find that both aggregate firm-level volatility and average stock market correlation have trended upwards. We estimate a linear model of the market risk–return relationship nested in an EGARCH(1, 1)-M model for conditional second moments. We then show that traditional estimates of the conditional risk–return relationship, that use ex-post excess-returns as the conditioning information set, lead to joint tests of the theoretical model (usually the ICAPM) and of the Efficient Market Hypothesis in its strong form. To overcome this problem we propose alternative measures of expected market risk based on implied volatility extracted from traded option prices and we discuss the conditions under which implied volatility depends solely on expected risk. We then regress market excess-returns on lagged market implied variance computed from implied market volatility to estimate the relationship between expected market excess-returns and expected market risk.We investigate whether, as predicted by the ICAPM, the expected market risk is the main factor in explaining the market risk premium and the latter is independent of aggregate idiosyncratic risk.

We simulate a multi-asset agent-based artificial stock market composed of heterogeneous agents with different degrees of relative risk aversion. As before, we find that the difference in risk aversion and the resultant saving behavior are the primary forces in determining the survivability of agents. In addition to the stability of the saving behavior, the level of the saving rate also plays a crucial role. The agents with stable saving behavior, e.g., the log-utility agents, may still become extinct because of their low saving rates, whereas the agents with unstable saving behavior may survive because of their high saving rates, implied by their highly risk-averse preferences.

We assess the ability of a general equilibrium New Keynesian asset-pricing model to account for these facts. We consider a production economy with elastic labor supply, staggered price and wage setting, as well as time-varying risk aversion through habit formation. We find that the model predicts a stock market response to policy shocks that matches empirical estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings are robust to a range of variations and parametrizations of the model. "

In the face of non-normality, this provides an appealing robust alternative to the routine use of the normal distribution. Specific distributions examined include the normal, student- t , slash and the variance gamma distributions. Using a Bayesian paradigm, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is introduced for parameter estimation. Moreover, the mixing parameters obtained as a by-product of the scale mixture representation can be used to identify outliers. The methods developed are applied to analyze daily stock returns data on S&amp;P500 index. Bayesian model selection criteria as well as out-of-sample forecasting results reveal that the \{SV\} models based on heavy-tailed \{SMN\} distributions provide significant improvement in model fit as well as prediction to the S&amp;P500 index data over the usual normal model.

However, only using a single trading rule may not be sufficient to predict the stock price trend accurately. Although some complex trading strategies combining various classes of trading rules have been proposed in the literature, they often pick only one rule for each class, which may lose valuable information from other rules in the same class. In this paper, a complex stock trading strategy, namely performance-based reward strategy (PRS), is proposed. \{PRS\} combines the two most popular classes of technical trading rules – moving average (MA) and trading range break-out (TRB). For both \{MA\} and TRB, \{PRS\} includes various combinations of the rule parameters to produce a universe of 140 component trading rules in all. Each component rule is assigned a starting weight, and a reward/penalty mechanism based on rules’ recent profit is proposed to update their weights over time. To determine the best parameter values of PRS, we employ an improved time variant particle swarm optimization (TVPSO) algorithm with the objective of maximizing the annual net profit generated by PRS. The experiments show that \{PRS\} outperforms all of the component rules in the testing period. To assess the significance of our trading results, we apply bootstrapping methodology to test three popular null models of stock return: the random walk, the AR(1) and the GARCH(1, 1). The results show that \{PRS\} is not consistent with these null models and has good predictive ability. "

The guiding \{GA\} (GGA) presented in this work, is able to extract \{IC\} with faster rate than the previous \{ICA\} algorithms, as input space dimension increases. It shows significant accuracy and robustness than the previous approaches in any case. In addition, we present a simple though effective contrast function which evaluates individuals of each population (candidate solutions) based (a) on estimating the probability densities of the outputs through histogram approximation and (b) evaluating higher-order statistics of the outputs.

This method is an extension of the adaptive lasso with nonnegative constraint on the coefficients. It is shown to have asymptotic unbiasedness, asymptotic normality and variable selection consistency and its mean squared error decays fast too. Comparing with other procedures, nonnegative adaptive lasso satisfies oracle properties and can select the true variables under fewer assumptions. To get the solution of the nonnegative adaptive lasso, we extend the multiplicative approach for computing. This algorithm is valid for the general framework where the number of regression parameters p is allowed to very large. Simulations are performed to illustrate above results. The constrained index tracking problem in the stock market without short sales is studied in the empirical part. A two-stage method, nonnegative adaptive lasso + nonnegative LS, is applied in the financial modeling. The tracking results indicate that nonnegative adaptive lasso and the two-stage method can both get small tracking error and is successful in assets selection. "

In addition, the behavior of the long and the short-run Efficient Frontiers (EFs) constructed by each of the sub-groups and the combined \{MENA\} markets is explored. Multi-objective international portfolio models are proposed under Mean-Variance and Mean-Lower Partial Moment frameworks, and the Multiple Fitness Function Genetic Algorithm (MFFGA) is used to find the \{EFs\} of optimal portfolios. The findings indicate that the stock markets of oil producing countries can be considered as a potential avenue for international portfolio diversification for investors not only from the same countries but also from the other \{MENA\} markets. It was also found that international portfolios constructed from the combination of \{MENA\} equity markets are more stable compared to the portfolios of sub-group markets. Further, the findings indicate that the behavior of short-term \{EFs\} in the \{MENA\} region cannot be predicted by the behavior of long-term EFs. "

This article proposes a technique for modeling and predicting this change in time series with a view to improving estimates and predictions. The technique is applied, among other models, to the hypernormal distribution recently proposed. When tested on real data from a range of stock market indices the technique produces better results that when a single distribution model is assumed to be valid for the entire period of time studied. Moreover, when a global model is postulated, it is highly recommended to select the hypernormal distribution parameter in the same likelihood maximization process. "

Feature selection, a pre-processing step of data mining, aims at filtering out unrepresentative variables from a given dataset for effective prediction. As using different feature selection methods will lead to different features selected and thus affect the prediction performance, the purpose of this paper is to combine multiple feature selection methods to identify more representative variables for better prediction. In particular, three well-known feature selection methods, which are Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and decision trees (CART), are used. The combination methods to filter out unrepresentative variables are based on union, intersection, and multi-intersection strategies. For the prediction model, the back-propagation neural network is developed. Experimental results show that the intersection between \{PCA\} and \{GA\} and the multi-intersection of PCA, GA, and \{CART\} perform the best, which are of 79% and 78.98% accuracy respectively. In addition, these two combined feature selection methods filter out near 80% unrepresentative features from 85 original variables, resulting in 14 and 17 important features respectively. These variables are the important factors for stock prediction and can be used for future investment decisions. "

  abstract  = {Abstract We employ a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP)-based learning algorithm to develop trading rules based on a survival of the fittest principle. Employing returns data for the Russell 1000, Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indices the \{STGP\} method produces greater returns compared to random walk benchmark forecasts, and the forecasting models are statistically significant in respect of their predictive effectiveness for all three indices both in- and out-of-sample. Using one-step-ahead \{STGP\} models to investigate the differences in return patterns between small and large stocks we demonstrate the superiority of models developed for small-cap stocks over those developed for large-cap stocks, indicating that small stocks are more predictable. We also investigate the relationship between trading volume and returns, and find that trading volume has negligible predictive strength, implying it is not advantageous to develop volume-based trading strategies. },

abstract={This study presents financial network indicators that can be applied to global stock market investment strategies. We propose to design both undirected and directed volatility networks of global stock market based on simple pair-wise correlation and system-wide connectedness of national stock indices using a vector auto-regressive model. We examine the effect and usefulness of network indicators by applying them as inputs for determining strategies via several machine learning approaches (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest). Two strategies are constructed considering stock price indices: (1) global stock market prediction strategy and (2) regional allocation strategy for developed market/emerging market. According to the results of the performance analysis, network indicators were proven to be important supplementary indicators in predicting global stock market and regional relative directions (up/down). In particular, these indicators were more effective during market crisis periods. This study is the first attempt to construct strategies for global portfolio management using financial network indicators and to suggest how network indicators can be used in practical fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Predicting stock price is a challenging problem as the market involve multi-agent activities with constantly changing environment. We propose a method of constrained evolutionary (CE) scheme that based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for stock price prediction. Stock market continuously subject to influences from government policy, investor activity, cooperation activity and many other hidden factors. Due to dynamic and non-linear nature of the market, individual stock price movement are usually hard to predict. Investment strategies used by regular investor usually require constant modification, remain secrecy and sometimes abandoned. One reason for such behavior is due to dynamic structure of the efficient market, where all revealed information will reflect upon the stock price, leads to dynamic behavior of the market and unprofitability of the static strategies. The CE scheme contains mechanisms which are temporal and environmental sensitive that triggers evolutionary changes of the model to create a dynamic response towards external factors. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Stock market is a very volatile in-deterministic system with vast number of factors influencing the direction of trend on varying scales and multiple layers. Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that the market is unbeatable. This makes predicting the uptrend or downtrend a very challenging task. This research aims to combine multiple existing techniques into a much more robust prediction model which can handle various scenarios in which investment can be beneficial. Existing techniques like sentiment analysis or neural network techniques can be too narrow in their approach and can lead to erroneous outcomes for varying scenarios. By combing both techniques, this prediction model can provide more accurate and flexible recommendations. Embedding technical indicators will guide the investor to minimize the risk and reap better returns. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, a lot of research is focusing on predicting real-world outcomes using Social networks data (for example, Twitter Data). Sentiment Analysis of the twitter data thus has become one of the key aspects of making predictions involving human sentiments. Stock market movements are very sensitive and it affects investment of the investors because of this prediction is the main interest of the researchers. Soft computing approaches and nature-inspired computing has a lot of potential in predicting the market movement. In this paper, soft computing techniques are used to predict market trends using sentiments extracted from market data. The results indicate that by selecting suitable neural networks architecture and selecting suitable regression coefficients can improve the overall accuracy and correlation of the predictions. Stock market information people use for investment decisions. Forecasting must be accurate otherwise it will not be effective in the decision. There are techniques like trend based classification, adaptive indicators selection and market trading signals are used in forecasting. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.},

abstract={Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a state-of-the-art technique for sequence learning. They are less commonly applied to financial time series predictions, yet inherently suitable for this domain. We deploy LSTM networks for predicting out-of-sample directional movements for the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from 1992 until 2015. With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading – they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs. Further regression analysis unveils low exposure of the LSTM returns to common sources of systematic risk – also compared to the three benchmark models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Market prediction has been an important machine learning research topic in recent decades. A neglected issue in prediction is having a model that can simultaneously pay attention to the interaction of global markets along historical data of the target markets being predicted. As a solution, we present a hybrid supervised semi-supervised model called HyS3 for direction of movement prediction. The graph-based semi-supervised part of HyS3 models the markets global interactions through a network designed with a novel continuous Kruskal-based graph construction algorithm called ConKruG. The supervised part of the model injects results extracted from each market's historical data to the network whenever the hybrid model allows with an innovative conditional mechanism. The significance of higher prediction accuracy of HyS3 is comparing to other models is proved statistically against other models including supervised models and network-based semi-supervised predictions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Bayesian Networks as a way to verify the extent to which stock market indices from around the globe influence iBOVESPA – the main index at the São Paulo Stock Exchange, Brazil. To do so, index directions were input to a network designed to reflect some intuitive dependencies amongst continental markets, moving through 24 and 48 h cycles, and outputting iBOVESPA's next day closing direction. Two different network topologies were tested, with different numbers of stock indices used in each test. Best results were obtained with the model that accounts for a single index per continent, up to 24 h before iBOVESPA's closing time. Mean accuracy with this configuration was around 71% (with almost 78% top accuracy). With results comparable to those of the related literature, our model has the further advantage of being simpler and more tractable for its users. Also, along with the fact that it not only gives the next day closing direction, but also furnishes the set of indices that influence iBovespa the most, the model lends itself both to academic research purposes and as one of the building blocks in more robust decision support systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The feature set which are the opening price, the closing price, the highest price and the lowest price are applied to fit the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Experiments on the four well known NASDAQ stocks (APPLE, FACBOOK GOOGLE, and AMAZON) show that our model provide the best performance in stock prediction. We compare LDA-online to ANN, KNN and Decision Tree in both Batch and Online learning scheme. We found that LDA-Online provided the best performance.

abstract={The foreign exchange (FOREX) market is a financial market in which participants, such as international banks, companies or private investors, can both invest in and speculate on exchange rates. This market is considered one of the largest financial markets in the world in terms of trading volume. Indeed, the just-in-time price prediction for a currency pair exchange rate (e.g. EUR/USD) provides valuable information for companies and investors as they can take different actions to improve their business. This paper introduces a new algorithm, inspired by the behaviour of macromolecules in dissolution, to model the evolution of the FOREX market, called the ENMX (elastic network model for FOREX market) algorithm. This algorithm allows the system to escape from a potential local minimum, so it can reproduce the unstable nature of the FOREX market, allowing the simulation to get away from equilibrium. ENMX introduces several novelties in the simulation of the FOREX market. First, ENMX enables the user to simulate the market evolution of up to 21 currency pairs, connected, and thus emulating behaviour of the real-world FOREX market. Second, the interaction between investors and each particular quotation, which may introduce slight deviations from the quotation prices, is represented by a random movement. We analyse different probability distributions like Gaussian and Pseudo-Voigt, the latter showing better behaviour distributions, to model the variations in quotation prices. Finally, the ENMX algorithm is also compared to traditional econometric approaches such as the VAR model and a driftless random walk, using a classical statistical and a profitability measure. The results show that the ENMX outperforms both models in terms of quality by a wide margin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Many researchers and practitioners have attempted to predict financial market trends for excess returns using multiple information sources including social media. Recent studies have investigated the relation between public sentiment and stock price movements and demonstrated that investment decisions are affected by public opinion. In this paper, we design a novel framework that combines the wisdom of crowds and technical analysis for financial market prediction using a new fusion strategy. A machine learning technique called deep random subspace ensembles (DRSE), which integrates deep learning algorithms and ensemble learning methods, is proposed according to the characteristics of the prediction task. Based on collected real-world datasets, the experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline models in predicting stock market by at least 14.2% in terms of AUC value, indicating the efficacy of DRSE as a viable mechanism for financial market prediction. © 2018},

abstract={The recent advance of deep learning has enabled trading algorithms to predict stock price movements more accurately. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap in the real-world deployment of this breakthrough. This paper presents DeepClue, a system built to bridge text-based deep learning models and end users through visually interpreting the key factors learned in the stock price prediction model. We make three contributions in DeepClue. First, by designing the deep neural network architecture for interpretation and applying an algorithm to extract relevant predictive factors, we provide a useful case on what can be interpreted out of the prediction model for end users. Second, by exploring hierarchies over the extracted factors and displaying these factors in an interactive, hierarchical visualization interface, we shed light on how to effectively communicate the interpreted model to end users. Third, we evaluate the integrated visualization system through two case studies in predicting the stock price with online financial news and company-related tweets from social media. Quantitative experiments comparing the proposed neural network architecture with state-of-the-art models and the human baseline are conducted and reported. All the study results demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepClue in helping to complete stock market investment and analysis tasks. IEEE},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of predicting the direction of stock movements for Chinese stock markets. In terms of feature extraction, six technical indicators are used as inputs for our model. Apart from that, we crawled lots of financial news from Netease Finance website and extract the headlines embedding in a vector as an additional feature. The study compares three prediction models, support vector machine, L1 regularized logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluation is carried out on historical data from January 2014 to October 2017 for five stocks. The experimental results show that the performance of all the prediction models is improved when those models add textual information features. © 2018 Acta Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Grounded on communication theories, we propose to use a data-mining algorithm to detect communication patterns within a company to determine if such patterns may reveal the performance of the company. Specifically, we would like to find out whether or not there exist any association relationships between the frequency of e-mail exchange of the key employees in a company and the performance of the company as reflected in its stock prices. If such relationships do exist, we would also like to know whether or not the company's stock price could be accurately predicted based on the detected relationships. To detect the association relationships, a data-mining algorithm is proposed here to mine e-mail communication records and historical stock prices so that based on the detected relationship, rules that can predict changes in stock prices can be constructed. Using the data-mining algorithm and a set of publicly available Enron e-mail corpus and Enron's stock prices recorded during the same period, we discovered the existence of interesting, statistically significant, association relationships in the data. In addition, we also discovered that these relationships can predict stock price movements with an average accuracy of around 80%. The results confirm the belief that corporate communication has identifiable patterns and such patterns can reveal meaningful information of corporate performance as reflected by such indicators as stock market performance. Given the increasing popularity of social networks, the mining of interesting communication patterns could provide insights into the development of many useful applications in many areas. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={There is a necessity to anticipate and identify changes in events points to a new direction in the stock exchange markets in line with the analysis of the oscillations of prices of financial assets. This need leads to argue about new alternatives in the prediction of financial time series using machine learning methods. This paper aims to describe the development of the SVR-wavelet model, an adaptive and hybrid prediction model, which integrates wavelet models and Support Vector Regression (SVR), for prediction of financial time series, particularly applied to Foreign Exchange Market (FOREX), obtained from a public knowledge base. The method consists of using the Discrete Wavelets Transform (DWT) to decompose data from FOREX time series, that are used as SVR input variables to predict new data. The adjusted series are compared with traditional models such as ARIMA and ARFIMA Model. In Addition, statistical tests like normality and unit root are performed to prove that the series in question have non-linear distribution and also to verify the level of correlation between the periods of the series. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel stock price trend prediction system that can predict both stock price movement and its interval of growth (or decline) rate within the predefined prediction durations. It utilizes an unsupervised heuristic algorithm to cut raw transaction data of each stock into multiple clips with the predefined fixed length and classifies them into four main classes (Up, Down, Flat, and Unknown) according to the shapes of their close prices. The clips in Up and Down can be further classified into different levels reflecting the extents of their growth (or decline) rates with respect to both close price and relative return rate. The features of clips include their prices and technical indices. The prediction models are trained from these clips by a combination of random forests, imbalance learning and feature selection. Evaluations on the seven-year Shenzhen Growth Enterprise Market (China) transaction data show that the proposed system can make effective predictions, is robust to the market volatility, and outperforms some existing methods in terms of accuracy and return per trade. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sentiment Analysis is new way of machine learning to extract opinion orientation (positive, negative, neutral) from a text segment written for any product, organization, person or any other entity. Sentiment Analysis can be used to predict the mood of people that have impact on stock prices, therefore it can help in prediction of actual stock movement. In order to exploit the benefits of sentiment analysis in stock market industry we have performed sentiment analysis on tweets related to Apple products, which are extracted from StockTwits (a social networking site) from 2010 to 2017. Along with tweets, we have also used market index data which is extracted from Yahoo Finance for the same period. The sentiment score of a tweet is calculated by sentiment analysis of tweets through SVM. As a result each tweet is categorized as bullish or bearish. Then sentiment score and market data is used to build a SVM model to predict next day's stock movement. Results show that there is positive relation between people opinion and market data and proposed work has an accuracy of 76.65% in stock prediction. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Collecting data from social networking sites is a popular way of opinion mining. These opinions show the sentimental state of a large number of people. In this paper, we have shown how much we can predict stock movement from Twitter's tweets sentiment analysis. Our work is done on one year's (2016) data of tweets that contained 'stock market', 'stocktwits', 'AAPL' keywords. 'AAPL' related tweets were used to see if these tweets can predict the company's stock indices whereas 'stock market', 'stocktwits' related tweets for predicting the stock market movement of US. Since we are predicting the stock values, we used Boosted Regression Tree model for this purpose. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={To explore profitable patterns in historical stock prices, ordinarily a promising pattern is selected by rule of thumb, and then its performance is verified by comparing the conditional return of the pattern with the unconditional benchmark return. We adopt an alternative philosophy: without any pre-selected pattern, the proposed method explores the entire graphic space to automate the identification of technical patterns. Derived from the K-nearest-neighbour (KNN) forecast, our method calculates the graphic similarity of patterns by the distance of the price vectors, and then classifies patterns according to the graphic similarity, and finally identifies patterns which contain predictive powers of the future market movement. KNN provides an excellent tool for probing the entire graphic space formed by price patterns to obtain an overall perspective of the effectiveness of technical patterns. Not only the well-known patterns but also the unnoticed and potentially informative patterns can be probed. To evaluate the performance, our method is compared with classic KNN forecast and technical trading rules. Results indicate that the stock market is relatively efficient and technical analysis is still effective to explore excess returns. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Stock market prices are becoming more and more volatile, largely due to improvements in technology and increased trading volume. Speculation affects business owners, investors, and policymakers alike. While these seemingly unpredictable trends continue, investors and consumers take to social media to share thoughts and opinions. We use information shared over StockTwits, a social media platform for investors, to better understand and predict individual stock prices. We designed and implemented three machine learning models to forecast stock prices using the dataset collected from StockTwits. We also evaluated our models with conclusions drawn from previous researchers in this field. Our first model found no correlation between general StockTwits postings and stock price. However, our second and third models considered a novel approach and successfully filtered through the twits to find important posts. These important twits could predict stock price movements with greater accuracy (average around 65%) based on sentiment analysis and smart user identification. We consider a user "smart" based on number of likes, follower count and more importantly how often the user is right about a stock. © 2017 IEEE.},

User-generated textual content on the Internet provides a precious source to reflect investor psychology and predicts stock prices as a complement to stock market data. This paper integrates sentiment analysis into a machine learning method based on support vector machine. Furthermore, we take the day-of-week effect into consideration and construct more reliable and realistic sentiment indexes. Empirical results illustrate that the accuracy of forecasting the movement direction of the SSE 50 Index can be as high as 89.93&#x0025; with a rise of 18.6&#x0025; after introducing sentiment variables. And, meanwhile, our model helps investors make wiser decisions. These findings also imply that sentiment probably contains precious information about the asset fundamental values and can be regarded as one of the leading indicators of the stock market. IEEE},

abstract={Mining hidden patterns with different technical indicators from the historical financial data has been regarded as an efficient way to determine the trading decisions in the financial market. Technical analysis has shown that a number of specific combinations of technical indicators could be treated as trading patterns for forecasting efficient trading directions. However, it is a challenging assignment to discover those combinations. In this paper, we innovatively propose to use a biclustering algorithm to detect the trading patterns. The discovered trading patterns are then utilized to forecast the market movement based on the Naive Bayesian algorithm. Finally, the Adaboost algorithm is applied to improve the accuracy of the forecasts. The proposed method was implemented on seven historical stock datasets and the average performance was compared with that of four existing algorithms. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other four algorithms and can provide a valuable reference in the financial investments. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={A stock market index can be a valuable indicator to describe the performance of a stock market in a particular region. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to forecast its future values or trends since the index data often demonstrate a high degree of fluctuations. Intrinsically, the wavelet denoising is a useful method to separate the signals from noise in many practical multi-media applications while the long-short-term-memory neural network (LSTM) is a powerful recurrent neutral network (RNN) architecture of learning and prediction models used in the field of computational intelligence. Nevertheless, few research studies have ever considered their combination for the prediction of stock or index movement. More importantly, some existing proposals trying to combine wavelet denoising with other artificial neural network architectures suffer from two major drawbacks. First, when applying the conventional one-time wavelet transform for denoising the stock data, this approach has made a serious logical flaw to include future stock data in its training phase, thus leading to impressive results in the backtesting yet actually impractical in real-world applications. In addition, the wavelet functions and decomposition levels are typically fixed in those studies for which they will not be able to produce optimal results in terms of the prediction accuracies. Hence, we propose in this paper a novel model to combine real-time wavelet denoising functions with the LSTM to predict the East Asian stock indexes in which the wavelet denoising adopts a sliding window mechanism to exclude the future data while its system configuration is flexibly optimized based on some predefined criteria. The empirical results reveal that the performance of our proposed prediction model shows significant improvements when compared to those of the original LSTM model without utilizing the wavelet denoising function. Furthermore, there are many interesting and possible directions including the integration with other deep learning networks for the future investigation of this work. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Most forecasting algorithms use a physical time scale for studying price movement in financial markets, making the flow of physical time discontinuous. The use of a physical time scale can make companies oblivious to significant activities in the market, which poses a risk. Directional changes is a different and newer approach, which uses an event-based time scale. This approach summarises data into alternating trends called upward directional change and downward directional change. Each of these trends are further dismembered into directional change (DC) event and overshoot (OS) event. We present a genetic programming (GP) algorithm that evolves equations that express linear and non-linear relationships between the length of DC and OS events in a given dataset. This allows us to have an expectation when a trend will reverse, which can lead to increased profitability. This novel trend reversal estimation approach is then used as part of a DC-based trading strategy. We aim to appraise whether the new knowledge can lead to greater excess return. We assess the efficiency of the modified trading strategy on 250 different directional changes datasets from five different thresholds and five different currency pairs, consisting of intraday data from the foreign exchange (Forex) spot market. Results show that our algorithm is able to return profitable trading strategies and statistically outperform state-of-the-art financial trading strategies, such as technical analysis, buy and hold and other DC-based trading strategies. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to forecast the stock prices called High-order-fuzzy-fluctuation-Trends-based Back Propagation(HTBP)Neural Network model. First, we compare each value of the historical training data with the previous day’s value to obtain a fluctuation trend time series (FTTS). On this basis, the FTTS blur into fuzzy time series (FFTS) based on the fluctuation of the increasing, equality, decreasing amplitude and direction. Since the relationship between FFTS and future wave trends is nonlinear, the HTBP neural network algorithm is used to find the mapping rules in the form of self-learning. Finally, the results of the algorithm output are used to predict future fluctuations. The proposed model provides some innovative features:(1)It combines fuzzy set theory and neural network algorithm to avoid overfitting problems existed in traditional models. (2)BP neural network algorithm can intelligently explore the internal rules of the actual existence of sequential data, without the need to analyze the influence factors of specific rules and the path of action. (3)The hybrid modal can reasonably remove noises from the internal rules by proper fuzzy treatment. This paper takes the TAIEX data set of Taiwan stock exchange as an example, and compares and analyzes the prediction performance of the model. The experimental results show that this method can predict the stock market in a very simple way. At the same time, we use this method to predict the Shanghai stock exchange composite index, and further verify the effectiveness and universality of the method. © 2018 Guan et al.

abstract={It has been an important task for business and individuals to make financial investments on stock market in order to wisely extend possible income sources. Such investments require precise timely decision and highly awareness of market changes at all time. Many well-known pricing models have already been proposed by different learnt researchers to explain the rationality between stock price and the covalent factors. These models were meant to assist information receivers to adjust their holding of stocks with reasonable pricing strategy and make wise financial decision timely. Since any newly entered information in the market shall be digested and cause stock price movement. By assuming that the stock market possesses sufficient efficiency to adjust stock price to the equilibrium status, a prediction made prior to such movement would be regarded possible. This paper has constructed a GPLAB financial customized prototype system and demonstrated certain accuracy in the forecast of stock price movements in TWSE (Taiwan Stock Exchange). The empirical study reveals that the system possesses a fair prediction ability of stock price movement in a random chosen period and a bear market period. Under certain restrictions that this model may serve as an early stock price changes awareness system. Such awareness may provide investors opportunity to adjust stock holding strategy timely. This study also believes the accuracy of forecast could have been further improved with the assistance of other tools such as deep learning and neuron network. The potential of genetic algorism application in the field of financing decisions could have also been further accomplished in the future. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Short - term price movements, contribute a considerable measure to the unpredictability of the securities exchanges. Accurately predicting the price fluctuations in stock market is a huge economical advantage. The aforementioned task is generally achieved by analyzing the company, this is called as fundamental analysis. Another method, which is undergoing a lot of research work recently, is to create a predictive algorithmic model using machine learning. To train machines to take trading decisions in such short - period of time, the latter method needs to be adopted. Deep Neural Networks, being the most exceptional innovation in Machine Learning, have been utilized to develop a short-term prediction model. This paper plans to forecast these short - term prices of stocks. 10 unique stocks recorded on New York Stock Exchange are considered for this review. The review essentially focuses on the prediction of these short - term prices leveraging the power of technical analysis. Technical Analysis guides the framework to understand the patterns from the historical prices fed into it, and attempts to probabilistically forecast the fleeting future prices of the stock under review. The paper discusses about two distinct sorts of Artificial Neural Networks, Feed Forward Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. The review uncovers that Feed Forwards Multilayer Perceptron perform superior to Long Short-Term Memory, at predicting the short - term prices of a stock. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents the results of method designed to predict price trends in the stock market. First objective of this research is to optimize the stock price trend prediction for short term using some oscillators and indicators: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Stochastic Oscillator (KDJ) and Bollinger Band (BB). It is observed that using appropriate pre-processing technique and Machine learning model, it is possible to improve accuracy rate of short-term trend prediction. Applying Preprocessing and then using combination of data can yield a better Accuracy rate in Short term Trades, while predicting for Long-term Trend of Stock this Technical indicators are not sufficient. Along with some of this Technical data and Fundamental Data of the company, it is possible to predict Long term stock movement. For Long term Prediction its Debt to Equity, Net profit of pervious 3 year, Promoters holding, Dividend yield and PE ratio is used along with Technical Factors. It is observed that using Fundamental and Technical Data, Long term Stock Prediction is Possible. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Most of the existing literature on stock price analysis is based on the historical price of a single stock, where models are trained to identify the pattern of price movements and, predict future stock the prices. However, the stock price is not an isolated variable. It is correlated with and influenced by many factors. These factors are highly time dependent, it which means that the stock price movement is also time dependent. Therefore, existing prediction models often fail in applications. In this paper, our model is not based on single stock. Instead, we study a class of stocks with similar historical price movements. We get the training and forecast data of the prediction model based on time series window sliding. We then train a CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and evaluate the model on testing data. Compared with the classical models for price movement forecast including the time series analysis model ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and the recursive neural network model LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory), our l empirical results support the effectiveness of the proposed method in the stock trend forecast. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Prediction of stock movements and share market has always remained an area of great curiosity and concern for investors. It has already been established that the movement of market shares a big correlation with the sentiments about it. In this paper, we have applied sentiments analysis techniques and machine learning principles to foretell the stock market trends of three major commodities, Gold, Silver and Crude oil. We have used the SentiWordNet library to quantify the emotions expressed in the text. Further neural network has been trained over the calculated readings. Thereafter, the trained neural network is used to forecast the future values. The efficacy of the proposed model is measured on the basis of mean absolute percentage error. The results clearly reflect that there in fact lies a strong correlation between public mood and stock market variations. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={The world has become data driven, which highly accentuated the utilization of information technology. The movements of stock markets are influenced, by both the micro as well as macro economic variables including the legal framework and taxation policies of the respective economies. The crux of the issue lies in exactly forecasting the future stock price movements of individual firms and stock indices, based on historical past prices. The accuracy, in forecasting the market trend, has become difficult due to the prevalence of stochastic behaviour and volatility in the stock prices and index movements. This paper analyses the nonlinear movement pattern of the most volatile, top three stocks in terms of market capitalization, listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India, namely Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Limited and HDFC Bank Limited, using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the study period from 2008 to 2017. The findings of the study would help the investors, to make rational, well informed investment decisions, to optimize the stock returns by investing in the most valuable stocks. © 2018 Allied Academies.},

abstract={The stock market is affected by many factors, such as political events, general economic conditions, and traders' expectations. Predicting the direction of stock markets movement has been one of the most widely investigated and challenging problems for investors and researchers as well. Many researchers focus on stock market analysis using advanced knowledge of mathematics, computer sciences, economics and many other disciplines. In this paper, we present an improved sine cosine algorithm (ISCA), which introduces an additional parameter into the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), to optimize the weights and basis of back propagation neural networks (BPNN). Thus, ISCA and BPNN are combined to create a new network, ISCA-BPNN, for predicting the directions of the opening stock prices for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average Indices, respectively. In addition, Google Trends data are taken into consideration for improving stock prediction. We analyze two types of prediction: Type I is the prediction without Google Trends and Type II is the prediction with Google Trends. The predictability of stock price direction is verified by using the hybrid ISCA-BPNN model. The experimental results indicate that ISCA-BPNN outperforms BPNN, GWO-BPNN, PSO-BPNN, WOA-BPNN and SCA-BPNN in terms of predicting the direction of the opening price for both types and significantly for Type II. The hit ratios for ISCA-BPNN with Google Trends reach 86.81% for the S&P 500 Index, and 88.98% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. Our results show that Google Trends can help in predicting the direction of the stock market index. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Given the potentially high impact of accurate financial market forecasting, there has been considerable research on time series analysis for financial markets. We present a new Intelligent Hybrid Weighted Fuzzy (IHWF) time series model to improve forecasting accuracy in financial markets, which are complex nonlinear time-sensitive systems, influenced by many factors. The IHWF model uniquely combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with a novel weighted fuzzy time series method. The model is enhanced by an Adaptive Sine-Cosine Human Learning Optimization (ASCHLO) algorithm to help find optimal parameters that further improve forecasting performance. EMD is a time series processing technique to extract the possible modes of various kinds of institutional and individual investors and traders, embedded in a given time series. Subsequently, the proposed weighted fuzzy time series method with chronological order based frequency and Neighborhood Volatility Direction (NVD) is analyzed and integrated with ASCHLO to determine the effective universe discourse, intervals and weights. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed model, we evaluate actual trading data of Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) from 1990 to 2004 and the findings are compared with other well-known forecasting models. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the listing models in terms of accuracy. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={As the technology applied to economy develops, more and more investors are paying attention to stock prediction. Therefore, research on stock prediction is becoming a hot area. In this paper, we propose to incorporate a joint model using the TransE model for representation learning and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which extracts features from financial news articles. This joint learning can improve the accuracy of text feature extraction while reducing the sparseness of news headlines. On the other hand, we present a joint feature extraction method which extracts feature vectors from both daily trading data and technical indicators. The approach is evaluated using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a traditional machine learning method and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model as a deep learning method. The proposed model is used to predict Apple’s stock price movement using the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (S&P 500). The experiments show that the accuracy of news sentiment classification for feature selection achieved 97.66% by model of joint learning, the performance of joint learning is better than feature extraction by CNN, the accuracy of stock price movement prediction through deep learning achieved 55.44%, this result is higher than traditional machine learning. This model can give the investors greater decision support. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={Prediction of stock price is always an interesting task. However, it is not easy to make this prediction with high accuracy. Recently, plenty of combinations of statistical methods have been proposed. The main direction of these methods is that combination of regression learner (e.g., SVM) and a clustering of data (e.g., SOM). While these methods make relative success, their extensibility is still under discussion. In this paper, we propose an hybrid model of self-organized map and integrated fuzzy rules with support vector machine. The proposition method is evaluated to be a good approach to apply to stock price analysis. Moreover, this method provides interpretable rules which can be understood, calibrated, and modified by experts in order to direct the learning phase. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={The prediction of stock price directions is important in finance. The Majority Voting Ensemble method is superior in prediction accuracy to single classifier models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine, but the computational cost is very expensive since it considers all the hyperparameters of single classifier models. The current study proposes a revision of the majority voting method to improve the computational efficiency. The proposed method lets each single classifier model find its own hyperparameter values and this modification speeds up the computation by 500 times compared to the standard majority voting method while maintaining the accuracy. The numerical experiments show the ranking of the classifier models in the order of the proposed majority voting, the standard majority voting, and then other single classifier models including the support vector machine. This improvement will allow the majority voting ensemble method to be applied in the financial market in practice. The algorithms are tested on 7 national indices from 3 continents for the past 3 years, and the performance is measured in two criteria, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the percent correctly classified. © 2018, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

abstract={Predicting returns in the stock market is usually posed as a forecasting problem where prices are predicted. Intrinsic volatility in the stock market across the globe makes the task of prediction challenging. Consequently, forecasting and diffusion modeling undermines a diverse range of problems encountered in predicting trends in the stock market. Minimizing forecasting error would minimize investment risk. In the current work, we pose the problem as a direction-predicting exercise signifying gains and losses. We develop an experimental framework for the classification problem which predicts whether stock prices will increase or decrease with respect to the price prevailing n days earlier. Two algorithms, random forests, and gradient boosted decisio‘n trees (using XGBoost) facilitate this connection by using ensembles of decision trees. We test our approach and report the accuracies for a variety of companies as improvement over existing predictions. A novelty of the current work is about the selection of technical indicators and their use as features, with high accuracy for medium to long-run prediction of stock price direction. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Stock Market (SM) is a significant sector of countries’ economy and represents a crucial role in the growth of their commerce and industry. Hence, discovering efficient ways to analyse and visualise stock market data is considered a significant issue in modern finance. The use of Data Mining (DM) techniques to predict stock market has been extensively studied using historical market prices but such approaches are constrained to make assessments within the scope of existing information, and thus they are not able to model any random behaviour of stock market or provide causes behind events. One area of limited success in stock market prediction comes from textual data, which is a rich source of information and analysing it may provide better understanding of random behaviours of the market. Text Mining (TM) combined with Random Forest (RF) algorithm offers a novel approach to study critical indicators, which contribute to the prediction of stock market abnormal movements. A Stock Market Random Forest-Text Mining system (SMRF-TM) is developed to mine the critical indicators related to the 2009 Dubai stock market debt standstill. Random forest is applied to classify the extracted features into a set of semantic classes, thus extending current approaches from three to eight classes: critical down, down, neutral, up, critical up, economic, social and political. The study demonstrates that Random Forest has outperformed the other classifiers and has achieved the best accuracy in classifying the bigram features extracted from the corpus. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Development of predictive modeling framework for observational data, exhibiting nonlinear and random characteristics, is a challenging task. In this study, a neoteric framework comprising tools of nonlinear dynamics and machine learning has been presented to carry out predictive modeling and assessing causal interrelationships of financial markets. Fractal analysis and recurrent quantification analysis are two components of nonlinear dynamics that have been applied to comprehend the evolutional dynamics of the markets in order to distinguish between a perfect random series and a biased one. Subsequently, three machine learning algorithms, namely random forest, boosting and group method of data handling, have been adopted for forecasting the future figures. Apart from proper identification of nature of the pattern and performing predictive modeling, effort has been made to discover long-rung interactions or co-movements among the said markets through Bayesian belief network as well. We have considered daily data of price of crude oil and natural gas, NIFTY energy index, and US dollar-Rupee rate for empirical analyses. Results justify the usage of presented research framework in effective forecasting and modeling causal influence. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Financial Prediction has always been an attractive area of study not only for academic research but also for commercial applications. In particular forecasting price movement of stock market, at least a one day ahead has been a goal of many traders. Gaining high profit with suitable investment is the dream of every investor, but it requires proper financial knowledge, analytical capability and ability for discovering the non-linear pattern hidden within the particular stock market data. Since neural networks have an inherent capability of learning and approximating nonlinear functions based on historical data so it is a very attractive tool for financial prediction. In this study a predictor model using Chebyshev Polynomial neural network (CPNN) is developed for one day a head prediction of closing price of stock indices. Further the parameters of the predictor model are estimated using the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. Being a parallel direct search algorithm, DE has the strength of finding global optimal solution regardless of the initial values of its few control parameters. Furthermore, the DE based algorithm aims to achieve an optimal solution with a rapid convergence rate. A comparative study of training CPNN using DE with respect to traditional back propagation (BP) algorithm and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is also provided on two benchmark stock indices. Experimental results clearly reveal the efficiency of the hybrid predictor model in term of two known error metrics such as Root mean square error and Mean absolute percentage error. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Data mining and big data analytic techniques are playing an important role in many application fields, including the financial markets. However, only few studies have focused on predicting daily stock market returns, and among these studies, the data mining procedures utilized are either incomplete or inefficient. This paper presents a comprehensive data mining process to forecast the daily direction of the S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) return based on 60 financial and economical features. The fuzzy c-means method (FCM) is initially used to cluster the preprocessed data. A principal component analysis (PCA) is applied next to the entire data set and each of seven clusters. The dimension of the entire cleaned data set is then reduced according to the combining results from the entire data set and each cluster. Corresponding to different levels of the dimensionality reduction, twelve new data sets are generated from the entire cleaned data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and logistic regression models are then used with the twelve transformed data sets for classification in order to forecast the daily direction of future market returns and indicate the efficiency of dimensionality reduction with PCA. A group of hypothesis tests are performed over the classification and simulation results to show that the ANNs give significantly higher classification accuracy than logistic regression, and that the trading strategies guided by the comprehensive cluster and classification mining procedure based on PCA and ANNs gain higher risk-adjusted profits than the comparison benchmarks, as well as those strategies guided by the forecasts based on PCA and logistic regression models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Company disclosures greatly aid in the process of financial decision-making; therefore, they are consulted by financial investors and automated traders before exercising ownership in stocks. While humans are usually able to correctly interpret the content, the same is rarely true of computerized decision support systems, which struggle with the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For instance, recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memories, employ hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However, deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep neural networks for financial decision support. We additionally experiment with transfer learning, in which we pre-train the network on a different corpus with a length of 139.1 million words. Our results reveal a higher directional accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning when predicting stock price movements in response to financial disclosures. Our work thereby helps to highlight the business value of deep learning and provides recommendations to practitioners and executives. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Foreign currency is bought and sold in the financial markets, every minute, every day, on trading days, like any commodity or stocks of companies. The players in this market are (a) people with underlying interest in foreign currency such as exporters and importers who are continuously hedging in futures or options markets, (b) speculators and (c) arbitrageurs. This paper focuses on this microeconomic flavour of foreign currency as a continuously tradable product and presents a granular framework for forecasting the exchange rate. We initially investigate year-wise inherent nature of movements of three exchange rates, namely Indian rupee/US dollar, Indian rupee/euro and Indian rupee/Japanese yen, during 2011–2016 through Mandelbrot’s single fractal model. Subsequently, maximal overlap discrete wavelet transformation (MODWT) is used to decompose the time series of the individual exchange rates. Random forest and bagging are applied on the decomposed components for predictive modelling. © 2017, © 2017 SAGE Publications India Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={Stock market or equity market have a profound impact in today's economy. A rise or fall in the share price has an important role in determining the investor's gain. The existing forecasting methods make use of both linear (AR,MA,ARIMA) and non-linear algorithms (ARCH,GARCH,Neural Networks),but they focus on predicting the stock index movement or price forecasting for a single company using the daily closing price. The proposed method is a model independent approach. Here we are not fitting the data to a specific model, rather we are identifying the latent dynamics existing in the data using deep learning architectures. In this work we use three different deep learning architectures for the price prediction of NSE listed companies and compares their performance. We are applying a sliding window approach for predicting future values on a short term basis.The performance of the models were quantified using percentage error. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently there have been many efforts to study the predictability of stock market trend using post sentiments on social media sites. These studies have mainly focused on US stock market. In this paper we investigate the relationship between stock price movement and social media sentiment in China, which has a large stock capitalization and a unique social media landscape. We collect data from several different types of social media sites (microblogs, chat rooms, web forums), and find that data from these sites exhibit distinct characteristics in activity level, post length, and correlation with stock market behavior. Users in stock market related chat rooms tend to post more but much shorter blogs. The activity level is much more highly correlated with market trading hours and stock trading volumes. We then investigated several machine learning models to classify post sentiment in chat rooms, and achieved a performance similar to the state-of-the-art sentiment analysis result for short posts. We find that there is strong correlation and Granger causality between chat room post sentiment and stock price movement, indicating that post sentiments can be used to improve the prediction of stock price return over using the historic stock trading information alone. We further propose a prediction model that uses chat room sentiment to forecast the market direction, and develop a trading strategy that utilizes the prediction as trading indicators. Backtest using our strategy achieves promising portfolio returns. A total return of 19.54% is obtained at the end of the seven-month period when taking into account of slippage and commissions, compared to a loss of -25.26% by a passive buy-and-hold baseline strategy. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The creation of a predictive system that correctly forecasts future changes of a stock price is crucial for investment management and algorithmic trading. The use of technical analysis for financial forecasting has been successfully employed by many researchers. Input window length is a time frame parameter required to be set when calculating many technical indicators. This study explores how the performance of the predictive system depends on a combination of a forecast horizon and an input window length for forecasting variable horizons. Technical indicators are used as input features for machine learning algorithms to forecast future directions of stock price movements. The dataset consists of ten years daily price time series for fifty stocks. The highest prediction performance is observed when the input window length is approximately equal to the forecast horizon. This novel pattern is studied using multiple performance metrics: prediction accuracy, winning rate, return per trade and Sharpe ratio. © 2017},

abstract={Forecasting financial time-series has long been among the most challenging problems in financial market analysis. In order to recognize the correct circumstances to enter or exit the markets investors usually employ statistical models (or even simple qualitative methods). However, the inherently noisy and stochastic nature of markets severely limits the forecasting accuracy of the used models. The introduction of electronic trading and the availability of large amounts of data allow for developing novel machine learning techniques that address some of the difficulties faced by the aforementioned methods. In this work we propose a deep learning methodology, based on recurrent neural networks, that can be used for predicting future price movements from large-scale high-frequency time-series data on Limit Order Books. The proposed method is evaluated using a large-scale dataset of limit order book events. © EURASIP 2017.},

abstract={Presented in this paper is a predicting model for time series forecasting of stock market index with the aid of bidirectional two-dimensional locality preserving projection and radial basis function neural network. First, 30 technical indicators in securities market are selected as the input features, and then adopts a sliding window to obtain the input data of the model. Next, by using two-dimensional locality preserving projection algorithm, reduction and feature extraction of the raw time series are performed in both horizontal and vertical direction. Finally, RBFNN is used to predict the closing price. Compared with the traditional dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and locality preserving projection (LPP), bidirectional two-dimensional locality preserving projection algorithm can be more effective to extract discriminating features. As verified on the Shanghai stock market index and the NASDAQ stock market index, the proposed model works well in ensuring the predicting accuracy which proves the effectiveness of this model in financial index time series prediction. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We offer a systematic analysis of the use of deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction. Its ability to extract features from a large set of raw data without relying on prior knowledge of predictors makes deep learning potentially attractive for stock market prediction at high frequencies. Deep learning algorithms vary considerably in the choice of network structure, activation function, and other model parameters, and their performance is known to depend heavily on the method of data representation. Our study attempts to provides a comprehensive and objective assessment of both the advantages and drawbacks of deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis and prediction. Using high-frequency intraday stock returns as input data, we examine the effects of three unsupervised feature extraction methods—principal component analysis, autoencoder, and the restricted Boltzmann machine—on the network's overall ability to predict future market behavior. Empirical results suggest that deep neural networks can extract additional information from the residuals of the autoregressive model and improve prediction performance; the same cannot be said when the autoregressive model is applied to the residuals of the network. Covariance estimation is also noticeably improved when the predictive network is applied to covariance-based market structure analysis. Our study offers practical insights and potentially useful directions for further investigation into how deep learning networks can be effectively used for stock market analysis and prediction. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Prediction in the stock market is challenging and complicated for investors. Many researches have performed to sense the future market movements. In the stock market, social media data have high impact today than ever. In this work, various prediction algorithms are analyzed to build a prediction model. The prediction model will be based on monthly prediction and daily prediction to forecast the next day market price. This model estimates the open value of the next day in the market. Sentiment Analysis needs to identify and extract sentiments from each individual in the social media. The correlation between the sentiments and the stock value is to be determined. A comparative study of these three algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network are done. The stock price is predicted by sentiment analysis with the best forecasting algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Trillions of dollars are traded daily on the foreign exchange (forex) market, making it the largest financial market in the world. Accurate forecasting of forex rates is a necessary element in any effective hedging or speculation strategy in the forex market. Time series models and shallow neural networks provide acceptable point estimates for future rates but are poor at predicting the direction of change and, hence, are not very useful for supporting profitable trading strategies. Machine learning classifiers trained on input features crafted based on domain knowledge produce marginally better results. The recent success of deep networks is partially attributable to their ability to learn abstract features from raw data. This motivates us to investigate the ability of deep convolution neural networks to predict the direction of change in forex rates. Exchange rates for the currency pairs EUR/USD, GBP/USD and JPY/USD are used in experiments. Results demonstrate that trained deep networks achieve satisfactory out-of-sample prediction accuracy.

In this paper, we attempt to make use of the same base dataset, with the difference of making use of a novel branch of machine learning techniques known as Deep Learning. These techniques have been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence. These deep architectures are known to excel in tasks such as image and text recognition, but have not been exploited as much in the field of finance. In particular, for this study we will be making use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to forecast the next period price direction with respect to the current price. We achieve an accuracy of 65% when forecasting the next month price direction and 60% for the next week price direction forecast. Whilst these results are anything but random, we are not able to match or surpass results obtained by industry leading techniques such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.},

abstract={Prediction of stock price is one of the most challenging tasks due to nonlinear nature of the stock data. Though numerous attempts have been made to predict the stock price by applying various techniques, yet the predicted price is not always accurate and even the error rate is high to some extent. Consequently, this paper endeavours to determine an efficient stock prediction strategy by implementing a combinatorial method of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Clustering and Non Linear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Technique. The study uses stock data from prominent stock market i.e. New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ and emerging stock market i.e. Malaysian Stock Market (Bursa Malaysia), Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). It applies K-means clustering algorithm to determine the most promising cluster, then MGWO is used to determine the classification rate and finally the stock price is predicted by applying NARX neural network algorithm. The prediction performance gained through experimentation is compared and assessed to guide the investors in making investment decision. The result through this technique is indeed promising as it has shown almost precise prediction and improved error rate. We have applied the hybrid Clustering-GWO-NARX neural network technique in predicting stock price. We intend to work with the effect of various factors in stock price movement and selection of parameters. We will further investigate the influence of company news either positive or negative in stock price movement. We would be also interested to predict the Stock indices. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Accounting and financial classification and prediction problems are high challenge and researchers use different methods to solve them. Methods and instruments for short time prediction of financial operations using artificial neural network are considered. The methods, used for prediction of financial data as well as the developed forecasting system with neural network are described in the paper. The architecture of a neural network used four different technical indicators, which are based on the raw data and the current day of the week is presented. The network developed is used for forecasting movement of stock prices one day ahead and consists of an input layer, one hidden layer and an output layer. The training method is algorithm with back propagation of the error. The main advantage of the developed system is self-determination of the optimal topology of neural network, due to which it becomes flexible and more precise The proposed system with neural network is universal and can be applied to various financial instruments using only basic technical indicators as input data. © 2017 Author(s).},

abstract={The popularity of many social media sites has prompted both academic and practical research on the possibility of mining social media data for the analysis of public sentiment. Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Twitter could be well correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, it remains unclear how public sentiment, as reflected on social media, can be used to predict stock price movement of a particular publicly-listed company. In this study, we attempt to fill this research void by proposing a technique, called SMeDA-SA, to mine Twitter data for sentiment analysis and then predict the stock movement of specific listed companies. For the purpose of experimentation, we collected 200 million tweets that mentioned one or more of 30 companies that were listed in NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. SMeDA-SA performs its task by first extracting ambiguous textual messages from these tweets to create a list of words that reflects public sentiment. SMeDA-SA then made use of a data mining algorithm to expand the word list by adding emotional phrases so as to better classify sentiments in the tweets. With SMeDA-SA, we discover that the stock movement of many companies can be predicted rather accurately with an average accuracy over 70%. This paper describes how SMeDA-SA can be used to mine social media date for sentiments. It also presents the key implications of our study. © 2017},

abstract={There are several commercial financial expert systems that can be used for trading on the stock exchange. However, their predictions are somewhat limited since they primarily rely on time-series analysis of the market. With the rise of the Internet, new forms of collective intelligence (e.g. Google and Wikipedia) have emerged, representing a new generation of “crowd-sourced” knowledge bases. They collate information on publicly traded companies, while capturing web traffic statistics that reflect the public's collective interest. Google and Wikipedia have become important “knowledge bases” for investors. In this research, we hypothesize that combining disparate online data sources with traditional time-series and technical indicators for a stock can provide a more effective and intelligent daily trading expert system. Three machine learning models, decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines, serve as the basis for our “inference engine”. To evaluate the performance of our expert system, we present a case study based on the AAPL (Apple NASDAQ) stock. Our expert system had an 85% accuracy in predicting the next-day AAPL stock movement, which outperforms the reported rates in the literature. Our results suggest that: (a) the knowledge base of financial expert systems can benefit from data captured from nontraditional “experts” like Google and Wikipedia; (b) diversifying the knowledge base by combining data from disparate sources can help improve the performance of financial expert systems; and (c) the use of simple machine learning models for inference and rule generation is appropriate with our rich knowledge database. Finally, an intelligent decision making tool is provided to assist investors in making trading decisions on any stock, commodity or index. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Forecasting the daily direction of the stock market has long been a fascinating problem. Many methods with different features have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy. We apply support vector machines (SVM) and gradient boosting (GB) to this problem, focusing on the NASDAQ index. Some special features are used, including features extracted from the global markets. We compare the performance with a buy and hold (BH) strategy. Our buying method is implemented at market open, buying and selling partial shares over three years in the QQQ, TQQQ, and SQQQ. Results indicate that, during an up market, out of the three algorithms tested, the SVM model is the superior predictor; the SVM model's return on investment (ROI) is 206.12% in contrast to an ROI of 173.53% for GB and 101.22% for BH. However, GB is the safest algorithm as with an ROI of 98.05% during a down market as opposed to ROIs of -79.13% and - 75.54% for the SVM and BH models, respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Market structure provides concrete information about the market. Price patterns can be imagined as the evidence of a supply and demand states in the market. Price shifts higher as the demands exceed the available supply and vice-versa. These patterns convey precious information about what is going to happen in the market. The purpose of this study is to investigate the underlying relation between price pattern in Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) Futures Index Market and its following trend. Forecasting the directions of price shift following the pattern through supervised learning and testing with artificial neural network (ANN). This research implements changepoint-analysis (CPA) under statistics field, and perceptually important points (PIP) theory. CPA finds the locations where the shifts in value occur. Then, PIP algorithm performs the feature extraction of the pattern. Then, the PIP is then fed to ANN to forecast the following trends. To simulate the research concept, a control model is built based on online time segmentation algorithm for comparison. The results of this research shows that robust patterns found by CPA have the ability to forecast market trend direction up to 83.6% accuracy. The result indicates that TAIFEX Futures market directions can be forecasted through its historical price robust patterns. Thus, rejecting that TAIFEX Futures Index Market follows random walk theory. In contrast, the control model which was built based on online time segmentation also has the ability to forecast but not as accurate as using the CPA method. In conclusion, analyzing the patterns reflected in the market effectively provide precious insights about its trends behavior. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Predictions on stock market prices are a great challenge due to the fact that it is an immensely complex, chaotic and dynamic environment. There are many studies from various areas aiming to take on that challenge and Machine Learning approaches have been the focus of many of them. There are many examples of Machine Learning algorithms been able to reach satisfactory results when doing that type of prediction. This article studies the usage of LSTM networks on that scenario, to predict future trends of stock prices based on the price history, alongside with technical analysis indicators. For that goal, a prediction model was built, and a series of experiments were executed and theirs results analyzed against a number of metrics to assess if this type of algorithm presents and improvements when compared to other Machine Learning methods and investment strategies. The results that were obtained are promising, getting up to an average of 55.9% of accuracy when predicting if the price of a particular stock is going to go up or not in the near future. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, Twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on Twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from Twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from Twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Mining knowledge from time series database is always a challenging task due to inherent complexity. Periodicity mining is one of the methods for analysing time series data in order to find regularities and other significant statistics. It has been studied for variety of applications such as stock market analysis, customer purchase sequence analysis, electricity power consumption, weather forecasting, spatiotemporal, social networks, biological data analysis etc. It reveals important observations and inferences about the temporal behavior and trends from the data under study and would assist in more effective strategy planning. There exists a number of algorithms in literature for periodicity mining. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the research to date on periodic pattern mining algorithms. It gives brief categorization of different types of periodicity, the mining techniques used and its merits and demerits. It will act as a compendium on periodicity mining for interested researchers in identifying promising research direction for further exploration. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The prediction of stock price movements is considered as a challenging task for financial time series analysis. The difficulty of predicting the trends lies in the dynamic temporality and noise in the stock data. The Echo State Network (ESN) is a popular time series prediction model that considers the temporality of the stock time series, but ESN often falls into the dilemma of over-fitting due to the existence of many unnecessary neurons in the hidden layer. To predict the stock price movements, in this paper, we propose Multi-objective Diversified Echo State Network (MODESN). MODESN assigns a diversity requirement to the ESN such that the network is able to maintain better generalization ability. Experiments are performed with Shanghai Composite index to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with classical Echo State Network, the proposed MODESN usually achieves higher accuracy and avoids over-fitting. The experimental results indicate that MODESN performs favorably compared with alternative methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Social sentiment reflects grassroots views regarding stock trends and has played a leading role in stock movements. Previous studies have relied predominantly on statistical models, regression models or vector-based predictive models to analyze the influence of social sentiment without considering other information sources or their intrinsic interactions. However, stock movements are in essence driven by various types of highly interrelated information sources including firm characteristics, social sentiment, and professional opinions. This paper describes the degree to which the problem arises in understanding the role of social sentiment in financial markets and proposes a novel intelligent stock analysis system to solve it. It first captures social sentiment and professional opinions from textual information in social media and financial news, respectively, and then represents the whole market information space consisting of these two information sources along with firm characteristics via tensors. Finally, a tensor-based learning algorithm is utilized to capture the interactions of these information sources on stock movements. Experiments performed on an entire year of data of China Securities Index (CSI 100) stocks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent system to study the role of social sentiment from the perspective of joint effects of multiple information sources compared with traditional vector-based systems. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper proposes a theoretical model of a decision support system for predicting stock prices based on data from social media. The model corresponds to the concept of multi-agent information system, which is characterized by parallel work of separate intelligent agents. In contrast to other projects in this area, the new model uses neither technical analysis approaches nor econometric tools, but machine-learning algorithms that can connect social network content sentiments and stock market movements. The practical realization of this model can be used for commercial purposes. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Classification is the attribution of labels to records according to a criterion automatically learned from a training set of labeled records. This task is needed in a huge number of practical applications, and consequently it has been studied intensively and several classification algorithms are available today. In finance, a stock market index is a measurement of value of a section of the stock market. It is often used to describe the aggregate trend of a market. One basic financial issue would be forecasting this trend. Clearly, such a stochastic value is very difficult to predict. However, technical analysis is a security analysis methodology developed to forecast the direction of prices through the study of past market data. Day trading consists in buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day. In this case, one interesting problem is the automatic individuation of favorable days for trading. We model this problem as a binary classification problem, and we provide datasets containing daily index values, the corresponding values of a selection of technical indicators, and the class label, which is 1 if the subsequent time period is favorable for day trading and 0 otherwise. These datasets can be used to test the behavior of different approaches in solving the day trading problem. © 2017 The Author},

abstract={Precisely predicting the stock price movement trend is essential for investors to gain enormous profit. However, due to the complicated financial environment, it is challenging to make an accurate market prediction. Machine learning is an effective tool to make such predictions. To build an effective investment strategy, selections of input features, prediction model with high accuracy, and buy-and-sell signals are very important factors. In this paper, we firstly screened out training features that are most relevant to stock price movement by calculating maximal information coefficient (MIC), then built an ensemble prediction model named SRAVoting basing on three outstanding classifiers on stock price movement trend prediction (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and AdaBoost (AB)), and proposed stock buy & sell strategies for day-span, week and month investing periods. Chinese stock price indexes and technical indicators were used to validate the proposed model and strategy. Result showed that SRAVoting model achieved higher prediction accuracy than SVM, while not necessarily higher annualized return rate than SVM based buy & sell strategies. Overall, the SRAVoting based strategies on different investing periods may benefit investors with positive returns. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is to construct a model to predict stock value movement using the opinion mining and clustering method to predict National Stock Exchange (NSE). We have used domain specific approach to predict the stocks from each domain we have taken some stock with maximum capitalization. Proposed Method is Not at all like past methodologies where the general states of mind or sentiments are considered, sentiments of the particular subjects of the organization or sector are fused into the stock prediction model. Topics and related opinion of shareholders are automatically extracted from the writings in a message board by utilizing our proposed strategy alongside isolating clusters of comparable sort of stocks from others using clustering algorithms. Proposed methodology will give us two output set i.e. one from sentiment analysis and another from clustering based prediction with respect to some specialized parameters of stock exchange. By examining both the results an efficient prediction is produced. In this paper stocks with maximum capitalization within all the important sectors are taken into consideration for empirical analysis. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A stock market is a public market for trading the company's stock. Prediction provides knowledgeable information regarding the current status of the stock price movement. Hence, it can be utilized in decision making for customers in finalizing whether to buy or sell the particular shares of a given stock. Stock market forecasters focus on developing a successful approach for forecast or predict index values of stock prices. Since in stock market, data are highly time variant and are normally in a nonlinear pattern, pre predicting the future price of a stock is highly challenging. From the evolution of machine learning, researchers from this area are busy to solve this problem effectively. Many different techniques are used to build predicting system. Here we describe the different state of the art techniques used for stock forecasting and compare them with respect to their pros and cons. Many methods like technical analysis, fundamental analysis, timeseries analysis etc are used to predict the price but none of these are proved as a consistently acceptable. Neural Network is the best technique till time to predict stock prices especially when some de-noising schemes are applied to a neural network. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is a popular way to identify unknown and hidden patterns in data which is suitable for share market prediction. The past data of the selected stock will be used for building and training the models. The results from the model will be used for comparison with the real data to ascertain the accuracy of the model. In this approach, we use back propagation algorithm for training phase and multilayer feed forward network as a network model for predicting the price of a share. © 2017 AMSE Press.

abstract={Automatically predicting stock market behavior using machine learning and/or data mining technologies is quite a challenging and complex task due to its dynamic nature and intrinsic volatility across global financial markets. Forecasting stock behavior solely based on historical prices may not perform well due to continuous, dynamic and in general unpredictable influence of various factors, e.g. economic status, political stability, voiced leaders’ opinions, emergency events, etc., which are often not reflected in historic data. It is, therefore, useful to look at other data sources for predicting direction of market movement. The objective of ISMIS 2017 Data Mining Competition was to verify whether experts’ recommendations can be used as a reliable basis for making informed decisions regarding investments in stock markets. The task was to predict a class of a return from an investment in different assets over the next three months, using only opinions given by financial experts. To address it, the trading prediction is formulated as a 3-class classification problem solved within supervised machine learning domain. Specifically, a hybrid classification system has been developed by combining traditional probabilistic Bayesian learning and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based on Feed-forward Neural Networks (NN). Assuming feature space narrowed down to just the latest experts recommendations probabilistic and ELM classifiers are trained and their outputs fed to train another baseline ELM classifier. The outputs from baseline classifiers are combined by voting at the decision level to generate final decision class.

abstract={In financial applications, stock-market trend prediction has long been a popular subject. In this research, we develop a new predictive model to improve the accuracy by enhancing the denoising process which includes a training set selection based on four K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifiers to generate a more representative training set and a denoising autoencoder-based deep architecture as kernel predictor. Considering the good agreement between closing price trends and daily extreme price movements, we forecast extreme price movements as an indirect channel for realising accurate price-trend prediction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of its accuracy compared with traditional machine-learning models in four principal Chinese stock indexes and nine leading individual stocks from nine different major industry sectors. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The artificial intelligence has been widely used in many different industries for many years. In particular, the deep learning approaches have profoundly improved the traditional banking services and generated a great impact on the financial industry. By using the artificial intelligence technology, the financial advisors will be able to explore various data sources, and the meaningful information can be discovered and analyzed more efficiently. In this study, both the conventional machine learning and current deep learning methods were applied to predict the trend direction of the weighted stock price index of Taiwan based on the panel data from associated Asian stock markets. A novel feature pattern constructed with the spatial and temporal correlation of the stock markets was used as the input to train neural network. The arrangement of two dimensional pattern for input data might facilitate the convolutional neural network to explore the embedded historical trend for stock index. Three different experiments were conducted to evaluate the prediction performance of models. The experimental results showed that the convolutional neural network built with 6 and 12 distinct kernels for convolution layers outperformed the other models, and achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Although the dimensionality of original input variables was increased, the result indicated the transformation of the input variables into a two dimensional feature pattern might be helpful for the deep learning approaches to learn the historical trend pattern.},

abstract={The advancement of information technology in financial applications nowadays have led to fast market-driven events that prompt flash decision-making and actions issued by computer algorithms. As a result, today's markets experience intense activity in the highly dynamic environment where trading systems respond to others at a much faster pace than before. This new breed of technology involves the implementation of high-speed trading strategies which generate significant portion of activity in the financial markets and present researchers with a wealth of information not available in traditional low-speed trading environments. In this study, we aim at developing feasible computational intelligence methodologies, particularly genetic algorithms (GA), to shed light on high-speed trading research using price data of stocks on the microscopic level. Our empirical results show that the proposed GA-based system is able to improve the accuracy of the prediction significantly for price movement, and we expect this GA-based methodology to advance the current state of research for high-speed trading and other relevant financial applications. © Copyright 2017 Chien-Feng Huang and Hsu-Chih Li.},

abstract={The model proposed in this paper, is a hybridization of fuzzy neural network (FNN) and a functional link neural system for time series data prediction. The TSK-type feedforward fuzzy neural network does not take the full advantage of the use of the fuzzy rule base in accurate input-output mapping and hence a hybrid model is developed using the Chebyshev polynomial functions to construct the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. The model to be known as locally recurrent neuro fuzzy information system (LRNFIS) is used to provide an expanded nonlinear transformation to the input space thereby increasing its dimension which will be adequate to capture the nonlinearities and chaotic variations in the time series. The locally recurrent nodes will provide feedback connections between outputs and inputs allowing signal flow in both forward and backward directions, giving the network a dynamic memory useful to mimic dynamic systems. For training the proposed LRNFIS, an improved firefly-harmony search (IFFHS) learning algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the consequent part and feedback loop parameters. Three real world time series databases like the electricity price of PJM electricity market, the widely studied currency exchange rates between US Dollar (USD) and other four currencies i.e. Australian Dollar (AUD), Swiss Franc (CHF), Mexican Peso (MXN), Brazilian Real (BRL), along with S&P 500 and Nikkei 225 stock market data are used for performance validation of the newly proposed LRNFIS. © 2017, the Authors.},

abstract={In the business sector, it has always been a difficult task to predict the exact daily price of the stock market index, hence, there is a great deal of research being conducted regarding the prediction of the direction of stock price index movement. Many factors such as political events, general economic conditions, and traders' expectations may have an influence on the stock market index. There are numerous research studies that use indicators to forecast the direction of the stock market index. In this study, we applied two types of input variables to predict the direction of the daily stock market index. The main contribution of this study is the ability to predict the direction of the next day's price of the Japanese stock market index by using an optimized artificial neural network (ANN) model. To improve the prediction accuracy of the trend of the stock market index in the future, we optimize the ANN model using genetic algorithms (GA). We demonstrate and verify the predictability of stock price direction by using the hybrid GA-ANN model and then compare the performance with prior studies. Empirical results show that the Type 2 input variables can generate a higher forecast accuracy and that it is possible to enhance the performance of the optimized ANN model. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate stock price forecasting is important for investors and traders to make informed trading decision. However, prices have a complex behavior due to their nonlinearity and nonstationarity. In this paper three Machine learning techniques are implemented to predict a very short term (10 minutes ahead) variations of the Moroccan stock market: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). A selection of technical indicators was used as inputs variables and a feature selection and samples selection steps were performed to improve prediction accuracy and training time. An eight-year period of intraday prices (tick-by-tick data) of Maroc Telecom (IAM) stocks is employed as experimental database to evaluate the performances of the selected models. The experimental results have shown that RF and GBT are superior to SVM for our dataset. Further, the low computational complexity and reduced training time of RF and GBT are suitable for short term forecasting. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We investigate the performance of complex trading rules in equity price direction prediction, over and above continuous-valued indicators and simple technical trading rules. Ten of the most popular technical analysis indicators are included in this research. We use Random Forest ensemble classifiers using minute-by-minute stock market data. Results show that our models have predictive power and yield better returns than the buy-and-hold strategy when disregarding transaction costs both in terms of number of stocks with profitable trades as well as overall returns. Moreover, our findings show that two-way and three-way combinations, i.e., complex trading rules, are important to 'beat' the buy-and-hold strategy. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Prediction of stock market is a challenging task that has attracted researchers in various fields including the computational intelligence and finance. Since stock market data sets are intrinsically large, nonlinear and time-varying, it is extremely difficult to design models for forecasting the future directions with an acceptable accuracy. In this paper, an integrative and intelligent machine learning framework is proposed through combining cloud computing, machine learning and heuristic optimization. Essentially, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is extended with the Grid Search (GS) or Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) as a heuristic optimization method together with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Feature Noise Filter (FNF) to construct quantitative investment forecasting models for efficient executions on cloud computing platforms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the Hang Seng Index and some major stocks listed on the Hong Kong Exchange are predicted using the constructed models on a daily basis. The empirical results clearly indicate that the proposed integrative approach is promising and gives impressive performance in terms of the prediction accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In the recent years, various financial forecasting systems have been developed using machine learning techniques. Deciding the relevant input variables for these systems is a crucial factor and their performances depend a lot on the choice of input variables. In this work, a set of fifty-five technical indicators has been considered based on their application in technical analysis as input feature to predict the future (one-day-ahead) direction of stock indices. This study proposes four hybrid prediction models that are combinations of four different feature selection techniques (Linear Correlation (LC), Rank Correlation (RC), Regression Relief (RR) and Random Forest (RF)), with proximal support vector machine (PSVM) classifier. The performance of these models has been evaluated for twelve different stock indices, on the basis of several performance metrics used in literature. A new performance measuring criteria, called joint prediction error (JPE) is also proposed for comparing the results. The empirical results obtained over a set of stock market indices from different international markets show that all hybrid models perform better than the individual PSVM prediction model. The comparison between the proposed models demonstrates superiority of RF-PSVM over all other prediction models. Empirical findings also suggest the superiority of a certain set of indicators over other indicators in achieving better results. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Causal discovery in observational data is crucial to a variety of scientific and business research. Although many causal discovery algorithms have been proposed in recent decades, none of them is effective enough in dealing with high-dimensional discrete data. The main challenge is the complex interactions among large volume of variables, leading to numerous spurious causalities found. In this work, we propose a novel multiple-cause discovery method combined with structure learning (McDSL) to eliminate the spurious causalities. The method is carried out in two phases. In the first phase, conditional independence test is used to distinguish direct causal candidates from the indirect ones. In the second phase, causal direction of multi-cause structure is carefully determined with a hybrid causal discovery method. Validation experiments on synthetic data showed that McDSL is reliable in discovering multi-cause structures and eliminating indirect causes. We then applied this algorithm in discovering multiple causes of stock return based on 13-year historical financial data of the Shanghai Stock Exchanges of China, and established a stock prediction model. Experimental results showed that the McDSL discovered causes revealed changes of key risk factors of the stock market over 13 years, which indicated investors should change their investment strategy over time. Moreover, the causes discovered by McDSL have better performance in predicting stock return than that of other common filter-based feature selection algorithms. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Efforts have been made in financial markets to deal with price movement predicting. Recent studies have shown that the market can be outperformed by methodologies with the aid of science. In other words, it has been shown that methods based on computational intelligence can be more profitable than a buy-and-hold strategy. This paper proposes a probabilistic and dynamic chart pattern recognition hybrid system, by using soft computing techniques, such as Linearized Fuzzy C-Medoids (LFCMdd), Perceptually Important Points (PIP), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Probabilistic Support Vector Machines (PSVM), to predict three important foreign exchange rates. Also, comparisons are performed against trading systems built with the use of technical indicators, optimized by Genetic Algorithms (GA). The experiments were performed with the sliding window strategy. The results showed that the proposed methodology outperformed the GA-based methodology, with mean return (ROI) of 277.6% against 20.96% for the GA-based. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A time series is a sequence of observations collected over fixed sampling intervals. Several real-world dynamic processes can be modeled as a time series, such as stock price movements, exchange rates, temperatures, among others. As a special kind of data stream, a time series may present concept drift, which affects negatively time series analysis and forecasting. Explicit drift detection methods based on monitoring the time series features may provide a better understanding of how concepts evolve over time than methods based on monitoring the forecasting error of a base predictor. In this paper, we propose an online explicit drift detection method that identifies concept drifts in time series by monitoring time series features, called Feature Extraction for Explicit Concept Drift Detection (FEDD). Computational experiments showed that FEDD performed better than error-based approaches in several linear and nonlinear artificial time series with abrupt and gradual concept drifts. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={News articles serve the purpose of spreading company's information to the investors either consciously or unconsciously in their trading strategies on the stock market. Because of the immense growth of the internet in the last decade, the amount of financial articles have experienced a significant growth. It is important to analyze the information as fast as possible so they can support the investors in making the smart trading decisions before the market has had time to adjust itself to the effect of the information. This paper proposes an approach of using time series analysis and improved text mining techniques to predict daily stock market directions. Experiment results show that our system achieved high accuracy (up to 73%) in predicting the stock trends. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A precise measure of corporates' operating performance play critical role in it achieving sustainable development during turbulent financial markets, because operating performance is a suitable reflection of corporate management, which has been widely recognized as the main cause of financial troubles. However, most proportion of previous works take return on assets or return on investment as a proxy for operating performance assessment, but both assessing measures merely consider one input and one output features, making them not appropriate for describing the whole facets of a corporate's operating situation. These limitations suggest that there is a need for additional analytical model for effective and useful prediction of corporate operating performance ranking. Thus, this study proposes a reliable and sophisticated prediction architecture that incorporates risk metrics, dimensionality reduction technique, data envelopment analysis, and artificial intelligence technique for corporate operating performance forecasting. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture can reduce unnecessary information, satisfactorily forecast the corporate operating performance ranking, and yield directions for properly allocating limited financial resource on reliable objects. The introduced architecture is a promising alternative for predicting corporate operating performance ranking, it can assist in both internal and external decision makers. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={These days the most crucial and commercially valuable information is becoming increasingly available on the World Wide Web. Companies which provide financial services are also making their products available on the web. As there are various types of web financial information sources, such as News Blogs, News Articles, Financial websites and Social Media, a lot of work is being carried out in the Stock Market domain using Data Analytics. This paper tries to find out if twitter sentiments and commodity prices help in predicting actual stock prices for top 50 companies listed on NIFTY at NSE, India, by using Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis and Machine Learning techniques. The results show that, Twitter sentiment gives 70% accuracy while predicting the actual stock prices and the accuracy is improved by 15% when integrated with commodity prices for making company-wise predictions. Furthermore, we check if analyst's recommendations have more impact on stock market price movements for all companies listed on NSE as compared to tweeter public sentiments. The results show that, analyst's recommendations contribute more with 9% of the increase in prediction accuracy. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={In stock market forecasting achieving good prediction accuracy is always been a highly challenging task for researchers and financial analyst. Forecasting stock market needs to deal with the most volatile, non-parametric and non-linear data sets. Also there are various factors that may affect the growth of stock market. So in order to make a good stock market forecasting system we need to use all the parameters that may affect the market volatility. Support Vectors Machine (SVM) have been found to be one of most efficient machine learning algorithm in modeling stock market prices and movements. Researchers are using these classification algorithms for so many years and have got a good predictive accuracy. Here in our research we have used SVM algorithm to making prediction for CNX NIFTY index value. In our experiment we have compared prediction accuracy for various Kernel Types of SVM. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The stock market is influenced by several factors, such as macroeconomics, regulatory, purely speculative ones, and many others. However, one of the most relevant and meaningful is the general opinion and the overall investors’ sentiment, i.e., what investors think about a certain firm and, as a consequence, about the relative stock. This investors’ sentiment is here proxied by the Twitter content, and the study sums up to the recent outbreak of works that exploit sentiment analysis and Twitter data for stock market predictions. The sample analyzed concerns three major technology companies over a two-months period, on a minute basis. Using microblogging activities and a scoring algorithm for each tweet, it was possible to formulate interesting forecasting models identifying a new set of variables and indicators of the stock market future movements. A selection model has been used to implement the study, and the evidences found were encouraging, since it has been possible to draw the conclusion that this new source of data may increase the explanatory power of financial forecasting models. More in detail, it looks like that the average sentiment associated to any tweet is not so relevant as expected in prediction terms, while the posting volume has a greater forecasting power and it could be used to augment the models. Although this kind of analysis are becoming mainstream and quite common, this work represents an interesting case study for the technological sector rather than advancing fundamental new techniques in the field. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Prediction of stock close price movements has attracted a lot of research interest. Using machine learning techniques, especially statistical classifiers, for day ahead forecasting of the movement of daily close prices of a broad range of several hundreds of liquid stocks is generally not very successful. We suspect that one of the reasons for failure is the relatively high volatility of prices in the last minutes before the market closes. There have been some attempts to use less volatile daily high prices instead, but the studies concentrated only on a specific non-statistical machine learning approach on a small number of specific securities. We show that incorporating statistical classifiers for day ahead daily high price movement predictions in to some simple portfolio management techniques significantly increases their performance. Tests performed on S&P 500 stocks show that such a strategy is robust, i.e. the difference in reliability for different stocks does not vary significantly, and that such a strategy greatly outperforms the S&P 500 index and several other benchmarks while increasing the risk only by a small amount. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper provides evidence that forecasts based on global stock returns transmission yield better returns in day trading, for both developed and emerging stock markets. The study investigates the performance of global stock market price transmission information in forecasting stock prices using support vector regression for six global markets—USA (Dow Jones, S&P500), UK (FTSE-100), India (NSE), Singapore (SGX), Hong Kong (Hang Seng) and China (Shanghai Stock Exchange) over the period 1999–2011. The empirical analysis shows that models with other global market price information outperform forecast models based merely on auto-regressive past lags and technical indicators. Shanghai stock index movement was predicted best by Hang Seng Index opening price (57.69), Hang Seng Index by previous day’s S&P500 closing price (54.34), FTSE by previous day’s S&P500 closing price (57.94), Straits Times Index by previous day’s Dow Jones closing price (54.44), Nifty by HSI opening price (60), S&P500 by STI closing price (55.31) and DJIA by HSI opening price (55.22), and Nifty was found to be the most predictable stock index. Trading using global cues-based forecast model generates greater returns than other models in all the markets. The study provides evidence that stock markets across the globe are integrated and the information on price transmission across markets, including emerging markets, can induce better returns in day trading. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={In the business sector, it has always been a difficult task to predict the exact daily price of the stock market index; hence, there is a great deal of research being conducted regarding the prediction of the direction of stock price index movement. Many factors such as political events, general economic conditions, and traders' expectations may have an influence on the stock market index. There are numerous research studies that use similar indicators to forecast the direction of the stock market index. In this study, we compare two basic types of input variables to predict the direction of the daily stock market index. The main contribution of this study is the ability to predict the direction of the next day's price of the Japanese stock market index by using an optimized artificial neural network (ANN) model. To improve the prediction accuracy of the trend of the stock market index in the future, we optimize the ANN model using genetic algorithms (GA). We demonstrate and verify the predictability of stock price direction by using the hybrid GA-ANN model and then compare the performance with prior studies. Empirical results show that the Type 2 input variables can generate a higher forecast accuracy and that it is possible to enhance the performance of the optimized ANN model by selecting input variables appropriately. © 2016 Qiu, Song.

abstract={Stock market analysis by using Information and Communication Technology methods is a dynamic and volatile domain. Over the past years, there has been an increasing focus on the development of modeling tools, especially when the expected outcomes appear to yield significant profits to the investors’ portfolios. In alignment with modern globalized economy, the available resources are becoming gradually more plentiful, thus difficult to be analyzed by standard statistical tools. Thus far, there have been a number of research papers that emphasize solely in past data from stock bond prices and other technical indicators. Nevertheless, throughout recent studies, prediction is also based on textual information, based on the logical assumption that the course of a stock price can also be affected by news articles and perhaps by public opinions, as posted on various Web 2.0 platforms. Despite the recent advances in Natural Language Processing and Data Mining, when data tend to grow both in number of records and attributes, numerous mining algorithms face significant difficulties, resulting in poor forecast ability. The aim of this study is to propose a potential answer to the problem, by considering a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian Inference approach, which estimates conditional probability distributions in structures obtained from a Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes algorithm. The novelty of this study is based on the fact that technical analysis contains the event and not the cause of the change, while textual data may interpret that cause. The paper takes into account a large number of technical indices, accompanied with features that are extracted by a text mining methodology, from financial news articles and opinions posted in different social media platforms. Previous research has demonstrated that due to the high-dimensionality and sparseness of such data, the majority of widespread Data Mining algorithms suffer from either convergence or accuracy problems. Results acquired from the experimental phase, including a virtual trading experiment, are promising. Certainly, as it is tedious for a human investor to read all daily news concerning a company and other financial information, a prediction system that could analyze such textual resources and find relations with price movement at future time frames is valuable. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper proposes a radial basis function (RBF) network trained using ridge extreme learning machine to predict the future trend from the past stock index values. Here the task of predicting future stock trend i.e. the up and down movements of stock price index values is cast as a classification problem. Recently extreme learning machine (ELM) is used as an efficient learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed forward neural networks (SLFNs). ELM has shown good generalization performances for many real applications with an extremely fast learning speed. To achieve better performance, an improved ELM with ridge regression called ridge ELM (RELM) is proposed in the study. Gaussian function is the most popular basis function used for RBFN in many applications. But the basis function may not be appropriate for all the applications. Hence the effect of the RBF network with seven different basis functions is compared for addressing the classification task. Again the performance of the RBF network is also compared with back propagation and ELM based learning over two benchmark financial data sets. Experimental results show that evaluating all recognized basis functions suitable for RBF networks is advantageous. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Business analytics techniques help mine and analyze business/financial data. For instance, a structural support vector machine (SSVM) can be used to perform classification on complex inputs such as the nodes of a graph structure. We connect collaborating companies in the information technology sector in an undirected graph and use an SSVM to predict positive or negative movement in their stock prices. By using a minimum graph-cutting algorithm to drive the cutting plane optimization problem of the SSVM, an exact solution is achieved in polynomial time. The learned model exploits the associative relationship between the prices of the collaborating companies to outperform the accuracy of a regular SVM. Experiments were conducted using the companies in the Standard and Poor's 500-45 Information Technology Sector index.

abstract={Stock market price is one of the most important indicators of a country's economic growth. That's why determining the exact movements of stock market price is considerably regarded. However, complex and uncertain behaviors of stock market make exact determination impossible and hence strong forecasting models are deeply desirable for investors' financial decision making process. This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of using technical indicators, such as simple moving average of close price, momentum close price, etc. in Turkish stock market. To capture the relationship between the technical indicators and the stock market for the period under investigation, hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, which consist in exploiting capabilities of Harmony Search (HS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), are used for selecting the most relevant technical indicators. In addition, this study simultaneously searches the most appropriate number of hidden neurons in hidden layer and in this respect; proposed models mitigate well-known problem of overfitting/underfitting of ANN. The comparison for each proposed model is done in four viewpoints: loss functions, return from investment analysis, buy and hold analysis, and graphical analysis. According to the statistical and financial performance of these models, HS based ANN model is found as a dominant model for stock market forecasting. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To study the influence of information on the behavior of stock markets, a common strategy in previous studies has been to concatenate the features of various information sources into one compound feature vector, a procedure thatmakes it more difficult to distinguish the effects of different information sources.We maintain that capturing the intrinsic relations among multiple information sources is important for predicting stock trends. The challenge lies in modeling the complex space of various sources and types of information and studying the effects of this information on stock market behavior. For this purpose, we introduce a tensorbased information framework to predict stock movements. Specifically, our framework models the complex investor information environment with tensors. A global dimensionality-reduction algorithm is used to capture the links among various information sources in a tensor, and a sequence of tensors is used to represent information gathered over time. Finally, a tensor-based predictive model to forecast stock movements, which is in essence a high-order tensor regression learning problem, is presented. Experiments performed on an entire year of data for China Securities Index stocks demonstrate that a trading system based on our framework outperforms the classic Top-N trading strategy and two state-of-the-art media-aware trading.},

abstract={Patent data has been used for generating patent-based indicators for tracking the technology development of high-tech companies. In this paper, we further show the promises of exploiting patent data for the analysis and prospecting of high-tech companies in the stock market. Specifically, we aim at investigating the relationship between the patent activities of high-tech companies and the dynamics of their stock price movement. While stock forecasting is a topic of general interest and has been studied extensively in the literature, the most popular forecasting models do not facilitate the discovery of the patent-activity impact all essential characteristics of the market performance of a given stock. To this end, we propose a new approach to analyze the relationships between patent activities and the statistical characteristics of stock prices. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a model of this nature, relating patent data mining and financial modeling. Also, we demonstrate the relationships of the market-adjusted stock returns and the number of patent applications as well as the diversity of the corresponding patent categories. Moreover, we establish relationships between the monthly drift and volatility of the market-adjusted stock returns and those patent activity indicators. Here, we exploit a widely accepted diffusion model of the stock returns and estimate its parameters. By adopting the moving window technique, we create fitted models by introducing various lagged terms of patent activity characteristics. For each company, we consider the coefficients of each significant term over the entire time horizon and perform further statistical testing on the overall significance of the corresponding indicator. The analysis has been performed on real-world stock trading data as well as patent data. The results confirm the significant impact of patent activity on stock movement and on its essential statistical characteristics of drift and volatility. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we examined the effects of financial news on Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HoSE) and we tried to predict the direction of VN30 Index after the news articles were published. In order to do this study, we got news articles from three big financial websites and we represented them as feature vectors. Recently, researchers have used machine learning technique to integrate with financial news in their prediction model. Actually, news articles are important factor that influences investors in a quick way so it is worth considering the news impact on predicting the stock market trends. Previous works focused only on market news or on the analysis of the stock quotes in the past to predict the stock market behavior in the future. We aim to build a stock trend prediction model using both stock news and stock prices of VN30 index that will be applied in Vietnam stock market while there has been a little focus on using news articles to predict the stock direction. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieved high accuracy in VN30 index trend prediction. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={How to predict stock price movements based on quantitative market data modeling is an attractive topic. In front of the market news and stock prices that are commonly believed as two important market data sources, how to extract and exploit the hidden information within the raw data and make both accurate and fast predictions simultaneously becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we present the design and architecture of our trading signal mining platform that employs extreme learning machine (ELM) to make stock price prediction based on those two data sources concurrently. Comprehensive experimental comparisons between ELM and the state-of-the-art learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), have been undertaken on the intra-day tick-by-tick data of the H-share market and contemporaneous news archives. The results have shown that (1) both RBF ELM and RBF SVM achieve higher prediction accuracy and faster prediction speed than BP-NN; (2) the RBF ELM achieves similar accuracy with the RBF SVM and (3) the RBF ELM has faster prediction speed than the RBF SVM. Simulations of a preliminary trading strategy with the signals are conducted. Results show that strategy with more accurate signals will make more profits with less risk. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={Stock market price movement prediction is quite difficult. This is primarily because of stock price time-series data is characterized by uncertainties, nonlinearities, and high-frequency multi-polynomial components. A variety of methods exist for providing stock market price prediction, with artificial neural networks using technical indicators forecasting variables, but the importance of each remains poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the quality of stock market price prediction made using Ensemble Neural Networks. This is accomplished by combining technical indicators which are classified into trend indicators, countertrend indicators and other indicators, BP neural networks (BPNN) for designing Ensemble Neural Networks with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of preprocessing of input data, and fuzzy systems of responses to forecast complex time series. We evaluate capability of the proposed approach by a variety of experiments from the Internet Firms engaged in Business-to-Business (B2B) of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Simulation results show that the stock market price prediction made by our approach is more accurate than Back-propagation Neural Networks (BPNN).},

abstract={Stock price prediction with high accuracy may offer significant opportunities for the investors who make decisions on making profit or having high gains over the stocks in stock markets. The aim of this study is to predict the movement directions (UP/DOWN) of the Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100 (ISE National 100) Index accurately for short-term futures by using three machine learning methods, which are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Two datasets used in this study are composed of sessional and daily points of data over a 5-year period from November 2007 to November 2012. During the prediction of the movement directions, the following factors were taken into account; data of macroeconomic indicators, gold prices, oil prices, foreign exchange prices, stock price indexes in various countries, and the data of ISE National 100 index for past sessions and prior days, which are used as input variables in the datasets. In connection with that, the most effective features of these input variables were determined by using some feature selection methods. As a result, the movement directions of ISE National 100 were predicted with higher accuracies by using reduced datasets than original datasets and the best performances were found by LR classifier. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={We present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach to predict stock market indices, particularly with respect to the forecast of their trend movements up or down. Exploiting different Neural Networks architectures, we provide numerical analysis of concrete financial time series. In particular, after a brief r´esum´e of the existing literature on the subject, we consider the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks techniques. We focus on the importance of choosing the correct input features, along with their preprocessing, for the specific learning algorithm one wants to use. Eventually, we consider the S&P500 historical time series, predicting trend on the basis of data from the past days, and proposing a novel approach based on combination of wavelets and CNN, which outperforms the basic neural networks ones. We show, that neural networks are able to predict financial time series movements even trained only on plain time series data and propose more ways to improve results. © 2016, North Atlantic University Union.

abstract={The portfolio management methodology discussed in the present paper combines the principles of Quality Engineering, Value Investing and Forecasting was able to beat the average market return with a huge margin. The portfolio management methodology allowed long and short positions on stocks and options. The portfolio management process outlined here made the portfolio focused and as a result the expenses associated with the transaction costs were lower. The main objective of this research is to propose a holistic approach for optimal, efficient and accurate portfolio management. In contemporary stock market conditions, three questions are crucial: What to buy or sell? How much to buy and sell? When to buy or sell? So the need of holistic approach has appeared; to forecast the stock price and the stock trends then optimize the portfolio. Besides that, the ability of volatility models to forecast future fluctuations of different asset classes is of interest to financial market participants. These arguments motivate our empirical future examination of the forecast quality of the SandP 100 implied volatility. Real case analysis and the forecasting results will reveal the limitations and the advantages of the proposed theoretical integrative-framework. Stock market analysis, also known as technical analysis, is the process of deriving patterns from price movement. In the literature, different methods have been applied in order to predict stock market returns. These methods can be grouped in four major categories: technical analysis methods, fundamental analysis methods, traditional time series forecasting, and machine learning methods ("Neuro-Logit", Artificial Neural Network based Logistic Regression Analysis). © IEOM Society International. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Predicting stock index and its movement has never been lack of attention among traders and professional analysts, because of the attractive financial gains. For the last two decades, extensive researches combined technical indicators with machine learning techniques to construct effective prediction models. This study is to investigate the impact of various data normalization methods on using support vector machine (SVM) and technical indicators to predict the price movement of stock index. The experimental results suggested that, the prediction system based on SVM and technical indicators, should carefully choose an appropriate data normalization method so as to avoid its negative influence on prediction accuracy and the processing time on training. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.},

abstract={Objectives: The nonlinearity of the stock market is widely accepted all over the world and to reveal such non- linearity the most effective technique has proved to be constructed through application of either data mining or neural network. Pharmaceutical sector is a rapidly growing in Bangladeshi stock market. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether the hybridization of data mining and neural network technique can be applied in predicting the stock price for Pharmaceutical sector of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Methods/Analysis: This study uses daily trade data for Pharmaceutical sector of DSE. We have analysed the behaviour of daily average price for Pharmaceutical sector of DSE. For this study, 6 top listed pharmaceutical companies have been selected to perform the analysis and selected time frame for the research is 15 years (2000-2015). The analysis is performed in two stages where first stage performs the K-means clustering of data mining method to discover the stock with most useful pattern and second stage applies the nonlinear autoregressive with Exogenous Input neural network method to predict the closing price for the selected stock. Findings: The prediction performance through the hybridization of data mining and neural network technique is evaluated and positive performance improvement of prediction is observed which is very encouraging for investors. The research also depicts that hybridization of data mining and neural network technique can be applied in determining the stock investment decision for Pharmaceutical sector of DSE though the impact of many different information has greater influence in determining the stock price. Novelty/Improvement: We intend to apply the data mining and optimized neural network in predicting stock market. We would like to work with the parameter and learning of the neural network to achieve better result. We will further investigate the effect of various factors viz. dollar price, gold price, FDI, bank interest rate etc. on stock price and index movement.},

abstract={Financial markets are notoriously complex environments, presenting vast amounts of noisy, yet potentially informative data. We consider the problem of forecasting financial time series from a wide range of information sources using online Gaussian Processes with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) kernels. We measure the performance gain, quantified in terms of Normalised Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Pearson correlation, from fusing each of four separate data domains: time series technicals, sentiment analysis, options market data and broker recommendations. We show evidence that ARD kernels produce meaningful feature rankings that help retain salient inputs and reduce input dimensionality, providing a framework for sifting through financial complexity. We measure the performance gain from fusing each domain's heterogeneous data streams into a single probabilistic model. In particular our findings highlight the critical value of options data in mapping out the curvature of price space and inspire an intuitive, novel direction for research in financial prediction. © 2016-IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Decision analytics commonly focuses on the text mining of financial news sources in order to provide managerial decision support and to predict stock market movements. Existing predictive frameworks almost exclusively apply traditional machine learning methods, whereas recent research indicates that these methods are not sufficiently capable of extracting suitable features and capturing the non-linear nature of complex tasks. As a remedy, novel deep learning models aim to overcome this issue by extending classical neural networks with additional hidden layers. Indeed, deep learning often provides a viable approach to achieve a high predictive performance. In this paper, we adapt the novel deep learning technique to financial decision support, where we aim to predict the direction of stock movements following financial disclosures. As a result, our paper shows how deep learning can outperform the accuracy of benchmarks for machine learning by 5.66 %.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that use several hidden layers. They have recently gained considerable attention in the speech transcription and image recognition community (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) for their superior predictive prop- erties including robustness to overfitting. However their application to financial market prediction has not been pre- viously researched, partly because of their computational complexity. This paper describes the application of DNNs to predicting financial market movement directions. A critical step in the viability of the approach in practice is the ability to effectively deploy the algorithm on general purpose high performance computing infrastructure. Using an Intel Xeon Phi co-processor with 61 cores, we describe the process for efficient implementation of the batched stochastic gradient descent algorithm and demonstrate a 11.4x speedup on the Intel Xeon Phi over a serial implementation on the Intel Xeon.},

abstract={The financial market is complex, evolving and dynamic system, which has an extremely non-linear movement. Thus, investment return prediction represents a significant challenge, especially because of its great diversity, unsteadiness and unstructured data with a high degree of instability and pronounced hidden connections. It is known that accurate prediction of the stock market indexes is very important for the development of effective trading strategies in investments. The main objective of the research is to perform the comparative analyses of different nonparametric methods, that is, fuzzy artificial neural networks (fuzzyANN) and genetic algorithm artificial neural networks (GAANN) for predicting the movements of the stock market indexes. The survey is conducted on the BELEX15, SBITOP, BUX and CROBEX stock market indexes. Model estimates were carried out through the prediction error MAE, MAPE and RMSE. The research results point to the adequacy of the nonparametric methods application in investments. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={According to the efficient market hypothesis, financial prices are unpredictable. However, meaningful advances have been achieved on anticipating market movements using machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose a novel method to represent the input for a stock price forecaster. The forecaster is able to predict stock prices from time series and additional information from web pages. Such information is extracted as structured events and represented in a compressed concept space. By using such representation with scalable forecasters, we reduced prediction error by about 10%, when compared to the traditional auto regressive models. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Accurate forecasting of upcoming trends in the capital markets is extremely important for algorithmic trading and investment management. Before making a trading decision, investors estimate the probability that a certain news item will influence the market based on the available information. Speculation among traders is often caused by the release of a breaking news article and results in price movements. Publications of news articles influence the market state that makes them a powerful source of data in financial forecasting. Recently, researchers have developed trend and price prediction models based on information extracted from news articles. However, to date no previous research that investigates the advantages of using news articles with different levels of relevance to the target stock has been conducted. This research study uses the multiple kernel learning technique to effectively combine information extracted from stock-specific and sub-industry-specific news articles for prediction of an upcoming price movement. News articles are divided into these two categories based on their relevance to a targeted stock and analyzed by separate kernels. The experimental results show that utilizing two categories of news improves the prediction accuracy in comparison with methods based on a single news category. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Financial time series forecasting is regarded as one of the most challenging applications of time series forecasting. Many researchers have been focusing on this topic due to the potential of yielding significant profits on the invested money in a short time frame. Believing in the predictability of stock markets, traders have been using Technical Analysis tools for a very long time to analyze and predict the behavior of stocks, aiming to make the best investment decisions possible with this information. In addition, applying machine learning techniques to predict stock market movements has become an area of research that has received a lot of attention in recent years. Popular algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines have been widely used in this area and they have been reporting satisfactory performances. As an attempt to improve the accuracy of these algorithms, researchers have been proposing techniques to combine them, forming Ensemble Systems. This work presents the design of an Ensemble System based on Genetic Algorithm for forecasting the weekly prices' trend in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa Index). In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted to compare it with other popular ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging, Boosting and Random Forests). Finally, the empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms the other ensemble methods. Therefore, this implies that the proposed approach can be used by traders as a promising tool for forecasting stock market prices. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Investors in stock market are usually greedy during bull markets and scared during bear markets. The greed or fear spreads across investors quickly. This is known as the herding effect, and often leads to a fast movement of stock prices. During such market regimes, stock prices change at a super-exponential rate and are normally followed by a trend reversal that corrects the previous overreaction. In this paper, we construct an indicator to measure the magnitude of the super-exponential growth of stock prices, by measuring the degree of the price network, generated from the price time series. Twelve major international stock indices have been investigated. Error diagram tests show that this new indicator has strong predictive power for financial extremes, both peaks and troughs. By varying the parameters used to construct the error diagram, we show the predictive power is very robust. The new indicator has a better performance than the LPPL pattern recognition indicator. © 2015 Yan, van Tuyll van Serooskerken.

abstract={Wavelet based multi-scale analysis of financial time series has attracted much attention, lately, from both the academia and practitioners from all around the world. The unceasing metamorphosis of the discipline of finance from its humble beginning as applied economics to the more sophisticated depiction as applied physics and applied psychology has revolutionized the way we perceive the market and its complexities. One such complexity is the presence of heterogeneous horizon agents in the market. In this context, we have performed a generous review of different aspects of horizon heterogeneity that has been successfully elucidated through the synergy between wavelet theory and finance. The evolution of wavelet has been succinctly delineated to bestow necessary information to the readers who are new to this field. The migration of wavelet into finance and its subsequent branching into different sub-divisions have been sketched. The pertinent literature on the impact of horizon heterogeneity on risk, asset pricing and inter-dependencies of the financial time series are explored. The significant contributions are collated and classified in accordance to their purpose and approach so that potential researcher and practitioners, interested in this subject, can be benefited. Future research possibilities in the direction of "agency cost mitigation" and "synergy between econophysics and behavioral finance in stock market forecasting" are also suggested in the paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Stock price direction prediction is an important issue in the financial world. Even small improvements in predictive performance can be very profitable. The purpose of this paper is to benchmark ensemble methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost and Kernel Factory) against single classifier models (Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbor). We gathered data from 5767 publicly listed European companies and used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a performance measure. Our predictions are one year ahead. The results indicate that Random Forest is the top algorithm followed by Support Vector Machines, Kernel Factory, AdaBoost, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression. This study contributes to literature in that it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to make such an extensive benchmark. The results clearly suggest that novel studies in the domain of stock price direction prediction should include ensembles in their sets of algorithms. Our extensive literature review evidently indicates that this is currently not the case. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Oil prices movements is very important macroeconomic factor for decision making. The accuracy of results for different types of oil brands depends on models and algorithms. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using fuzzy sets to forecast daily Brent oil prices. It also contains possible modifications of the proposed method and in comparison with basic methods. The results suggest that Brent oil prices series have short memory because using information about last 2-days prices shows better forecast accuracy. Forecasting based on fixed universe of discourse shows better efficiency and it also proves that oil prices series has short memory. Adding the probability of switching between linguistic terms in defuzzification function could be used to improve accuracy of predictions. Also the approach can take into consideration expert’s opinion about direction of future variation. The effective expert’s work can reduce errors of forecast from 1.5% till 0.76%. But this modification can be used if experts correctly guess the direction of the change in trend in eight out of ten cases and more.

abstract={The majority of existing artificial intelligence (AI) studies in computational finance literature are devoted solely to predicting market movements. In this paper we shift the attention to how AI can be applied to control risk-based money management decisions. We propose an innovative fuzzy logic approach which identifies and categorizes technical rules performance across different regions in the trend and volatility space. The model dynamically prioritizes higher performing regions at an intraday level and adapts money management policies with the objective to maximize global risk-adjusted performance. By adopting a hybrid method in conjunction with a popular neural network (NN) trend prediction model, our results show significant performance improvements compared with both standard NN and buy-and-hold approaches. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper proposes an EMD-LSSVM (empirical mode decomposition least squares support vector machine) model to analyze the CSI 300 index. A WD-LSSVM (wavelet denoising least squares support machine) is also proposed as a benchmark to compare with the performance of EMD-LSSVM. Since parameters selection is vital to the performance of the model, different optimization methods are used, including simplex, GS (grid search), PSO (particle swarm optimization), and GA (genetic algorithm). Experimental results show that the EMD-LSSVM model with GS algorithm outperforms other methods in predicting stock market movement direction. © 2015 Jian Chai et al.},

abstract={The issue of using Twitter data to increase the prediction rate of stock price movements draws attention of many researchers. In this paper we examine the possibility of analyzing Twitter users' emoticons to improve accuracy of predictions for DJIA and S&P500 stock market indices. We analyzed 1.6 billion tweets downloaded from February 13, 2013 to May 19, 2014. As a forecasting technique, we tested the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks and Random Forest, which are commonly used for prediction tasks in finance analytics. The results of applying machine learning techniques to stock market price prediction are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

It has undergone periods where trading gains exceeded that of major markets such as the London Stock Exchange. This paper focuses on machine learning algorithms including decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines used to predict the JSE. Selected algorithms were applied to trading data over a 22 month period for price and trend forecasting and a 12-year period for volume forecasts. Experimental results show 90% accuracy in the movement prediction and 0.95 correlation coefficient for price prediction. Volume predictions were enhanced by a discretization method and support vector machine to yield over 70% accuracy.},

abstract={We revisit the problem of predicting directional movements of stock prices based on news articles: here our algorithm uses daily articles from The Wall Street Journal to predict the closing stock prices on the same day. We propose a unified latent space model to characterize the 'co-movements' between stock prices and news articles. Unlike many existing approaches, our new model is able to simultaneously leverage the correlations: (a) among stock prices, (b) among news articles, and (c) between stock prices and news articles. Thus, our model is able to make daily predictions on more than 500 stocks (most of which are not even mentioned in any news article) while having low complexity. We carry out extensive back testing on trading strategies based on our algorithm. The result shows that our model has substantially better accuracy rate (55.7%) compared to many widely used algorithms. The return (56%) and Sharpe ratio due to a trading strategy based on our model are also much higher than baseline indices. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Various examinations are performed to predict the stock values, yet not many points at assessing the predictability of the direction of stock index movement. Stock market prediction with data mining method is a standout amongst the most paramount issues to be researched and it is one of the interesting issues of stock market research over several decades. The approach of advanced data mining tools and refined database innovations has empowered specialists to handle the immense measure of data created by the dynamic stock market. Data mining strategies have been utilized to reveal hidden patterns and predict future patterns and practices in financial markets to help financial investors make qualitative choice. In this paper, the consistency of stock index movement of the well-known Indian Stock Market indices NSE-NIFTY are examined with the assistance of famous data mining strategies known as Clustering. Clustering is the methodology of grouping the alike indices into clusters. It likewise audits three of the meta-heuristics clustering algorithms: PSO-K-Means, Bat Algorithm, and firefly Algorithm. These strategies are implemented and tested against a Stock Market Index Movement Dataset. The performance of the aforementioned procedures is compared based on "integrity of clustering" assessment measures. The investigation is used to the NSE-NIFTY and BSE-NIFTY for the period from January 2011 to April 2014. © 2015, Gazi University Eti Mahallesi. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper addresses problem of predicting direction of movement of stock and stock price index for Indian stock markets. The study compares four prediction models, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest and naive-Bayes with two approaches for input to these models. The first approach for input data involves computation of ten technical parameters using stock trading data (open, high, low & close prices) while the second approach focuses on representing these technical parameters as trend deterministic data. Accuracy of each of the prediction models for each of the two input approaches is evaluated. Evaluation is carried out on 10 years of historical data from 2003 to 2012 of two stocks namely Reliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. and two stock price indices CNX Nifty and S&P Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex. The experimental results suggest that for the first approach of input data where ten technical parameters are represented as continuous values, random forest outperforms other three prediction models on overall performance. Experimental results also show that the performance of all the prediction models improve when these technical parameters are represented as trend deterministic data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Sentiment analysis is a content-analytic investigative framework for researchers, traders and the general public involved in financial markets. This analysis is based on carefully sourced and elaborately constructed proxies for market sentiment and has emerged as a basis for analysing movements in stock prices and the associated traded volume. This approach is particularly helpful just before and after the onset of market volatility. We use an autoregressive framework for predicting the overall changes in stock prices by using investor sentiment together with lagged variables of prices and trading volumes. The case study we use is a small market index (Danish Stock Exchange Index, OMXC 20, together with prevailing sentiment in Denmark, to evaluate the impact of sentiment on OMXC 20. Furthermore, we introduce a rather novel and quantitative sentiment proxy, that is the use of the index of a larger market (US S&P 500), to see how the smaller market reacts to changes in the larger market. The use of larger market index is justified on economic/ financial grounds in that globalisation has introduced a degree of interdependence, and allow us to explore global influences as a proxy for sentiment. We look at the robustness of our prediction. (Local) Negative sentiment (as articulated in Danish newspapers over a 7 year period (2007-2013), does have an impact on the local markets, but the global market (S&P 500) has an even greater impact. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Social Networks are becoming very popular sources of all kind of data. They allow a wide range of users to interact, socialize and express spontaneous opinions. The overwhelming amount of exchanged data on businesses, companies and governments make it possible to perform predictions and discover trends in many domains. In this paper we propose a new prediction model for the stock market movement problem based on collective classification. The model is using a number of public mood states as inputs to predict Up and Down movement of stock market. The proposed approach to build such a model is simultaneously promoting performance and interpretability. By interpretability, we mean the ability of a model to explain its predictions. A particular implementation of our approach is based on Ant Colony Optimization algorithm and customized for individual Bayesian classifiers. Our approach is validated with data collected from social media on the stock of a prestigious company. Promising results of our approach are compared with four alternative prediction methods namely, bagging, Adaboost, best expert, and expert trained on all the available data. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

abstract={The volatile and complex market of agricultural futures' contracts creates difficulty in predicting future price movements. Many things affect commodity data, including weather, sentiment, supply, and demand. Hence, by its very nature, this data is non-linear. Charting and technical trading are used by brokers to find trends and movements in the market; however, trading using these strategies with uncertain situations can become risky. Moreover, technical and charting strategies tend to create signals to buy and sell in the market later, rather than sooner. Some commodity traders still feel as though computer generated trades can lead to greater losses compared to more traditional methods. Thus, the purpose of this research is to use a hybrid neuro-fuzzy model to create predictive entry and exit trades in the soy market. Data from the CME soybean, soy oil, and soymeal futures markets will be used to show that computational intelligence methods are comparable, facilitating profitability in complex markets. © American Society for Engineering Management, 2015.},

abstract={Fractals are self-similar recursive structures that have been used in modeling several real world processes. In this work we study how "fractal-like" processes arise in a prediction game where an adversary is generating a sequence of bits and an algorithm is trying to predict them. We will see that under a certain formalization of the predictive payoff for the algorithm it is most optimal for the adversary to produce a fractal-like sequence to minimize the algorithm's ability to predict. Indeed it has been suggested before that financial markets exhibit a fractal-like behavior [FP98, Man05]. We prove that a fractal-like distribution arises naturally out of an optimization from the adversary's perspective. In addition, we give optimal trade-offs between predictability and expected deviation (i.e. sum of bits) for our formalization of predictive payoff. This result is motivated by the observation that several time series data exhibit higher deviations than expected for a completely random walk. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper we explore the effectiveness of two nonparametric methods, based upon a matrix spectral decomposition approach, namely the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). The intended area of applications is that of forecasting fuzzy-valued and multivariate time series. Given a multivariate time series, ICA assumes that each of its components is a mixture of several independent underlying factors. Separating such distinct time-varying causal factors becomes crucial in multivariate financial time series analysis, when attempting to explain past co-movements and to predict future evolutions. The multivariate extension of SSA (MSSA) can be employed as a powerful prediction tool, either separately, or in conjunction with ICA. As a first application, we use MSSA to recurrently forecasting triangular-shaped fuzzy monthly exchange rates, thus aiming at capturing both the randomness and the fuzziness of the financial process. A hybrid ICA-SSA approach is also proposed. The primarily role of ICA is to reveal certain fundamental factors behind several parallel series of foreign exchange rates. More accurate predictions can be performed via these independent components, after their separation. MSSA is employed to compute forecasts of independent factors. Afterwards, these forecasts of underlying factors are remixed into the forecasts of observable foreign exchange rates. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Whilst the interest of many former studies on the application of AI in finance is solely on predicting market movements, trading practitioners are predominantly concerned about risk-adjusted performance. This paper provides new insights into improving the time-varying risk-adjusted performance of trading systems controlled by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) or Dynamic Evolving Neuro Fuzzy Systems (DENFIS). Contrary to most former studies which focus on daily predictions, we compare these models in an intraday stock trading scenario using high-frequency data. Firstly, we propose a dynamic extension of the popular moving average rule and enhance it with a model validation methodology using heat maps to analyse favourable profitability in specific holding time and signal regions. Secondly, we study the effect of realistic constraints such as transaction costs and intraday trading hours, which many existing approaches in the literature ignore. Thirdly, unlike most former studies that only aim to minimise statistical error measures, we compare this approach with financially more relevant risk-adjusted objective functions. To this end, we also consider an innovative ANFIS ensemble architecture which on an intraday level dynamically selects between different risk-adjusted models. Our study shows that accounting for transaction costs and the use of risk-return objective functions provide better results in out-of-sample tests. Overall, the ANN model is identified as a viable model, however ANFIS shows more stable time-varying performance across multiple market regimes. Moreover, we find that combining multiple risk-adjusted objective functions using an ANFIS ensemble yields promising results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={After reviewing the vast body of literature on using FTS in stock market forecasting, certain deficiencies are distinguished in the hybridization of findings. In addition, the lack of constructive systematic framework, which can be helpful to indicate direction of growth in entire FTS forecasting systems, is outstanding. In this study, we propose a multilayer model for stock market forecasting including five logical significant layers. Every single layer has its detailed concern to assist forecast development by reconciling certain problems exclusively. To verify the model, a set of huge data containing Taiwan Stock Index (TAIEX), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), and S&P 500 have been chosen as experimental datasets. The results indicate that the proposed methodology has the potential to be accepted as a framework for model development in stock market forecasts using FTS. © 2014 Hossein Javedani Sadaei and Muhammad Hisyam Lee.},

abstract={Numerous stock market analysis methods have been proposed from simple moving average to the use of artificial intelligence such as neural networks and Bayesian networks. In this paper, we introduce a new concept and a methodology that enable predictability of asset price movement in the market by way of inference from the past data. We use schema to describe an economic instance, and a set of schema in time series to describe the flow of economic instances in the past. Within the schema, we introduce a concept of velocity and momentum to effectively characterize the dynamic nature of the market. We compare the current and the past instances to identify resemblance and take inference as a predictive capability of future asset price movement. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract={Predicting the behaviors of the stock markets are always an interesting topic for not only financial investors but also scholars and professionals from different fields, because successful prediction can help investors to yield significant profits. Previous researchers have shown the strong correlation between financial news and their impacts to the movements of stock prices. This paper proposes an approach of using time series analysis and text mining techniques to predict daily stock market trends. The research is conducted with the utilization of a database containing stock index prices and news articles collected from Vietnam websites over 3 years from 2010 to 2012. A robust feature selection and a strong machine learning algorithm are able to lift the forecasting accuracy. By combining Linear Support Vector Machine Weight and Support Vector Machine algorithm, this proposed approach can enhance the prediction accuracy significantly above those of related research approaches. The results show that data set represented by 42 features achieves the highest accuracy by using one-against-one Support Vector Machines (up to 75%) and one-against-one method outperforms one-againstall method in almost all case studies.},

abstract={We propose a method for collective sentiment analysis for stock market prediction and analyse its ability to predict the change of a stock price for the next day. The proposed method is a two-stage process, based on the latest natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. Our evaluation shows best performance with the SVM approach in sentiment detection, with accuracy rates of 71.84/74.3% for positive and negative sentiment, respectively. The results of sentiment analysis are used in predicting stock price movement (up or down), and we found that users' activity on Stock Twits overnight positively correlates with stock trading on the next business day. The collective sentiments in after hours have powerful prediction on the change of stock price for the next day in 9 out of 15 stocks studied by using the Granger Causality test. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This chapter makes an attempt to address three critical issues that, from a computational intelligence perspective, will arise when computational stock market model (CSMM) based complex adaptive cyber physical logistics system (CACPLS) is implemented in the future supply network. The chapter starts with an introduction and background description about the necessity of introducing the CSMM-based CACPLS; then the focal problems (i.e., developing investment strategy, predicting stock price, and controlling extreme events) of this chapter is stated in the problem statement section; a detailed description about our approaches, i.e., training artificial neural network via particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm for stock price forecasting, and agent-based modeling and simulation for preventing extreme events, together with three example studies can be found in the subsequent proposed methodology sections; right after this, the potential research directions regarding the key problems considered in this chapter are highlighted in the future trends section; finally, the conclusions drawn at the last section closes this chapter. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.},

abstract={Data mining and machine learning approaches can be incorporated into business intelligence (BI) systems to help users for decision support in many real-life applications. Here, in this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for BI applications. Specifically, we apply structural support vector machines (SSVMs) to perform classification on complex inputs such as the nodes of a graph structure. We connect collaborating companies in the information technology sector in a graph structure and use an SSVM to predict positive or negative movement in their stock prices. The complexity of the SSVM cutting plane optimization problem is determined by the complexity of the separation oracle. It is shown that (i) the seporation oracle performs a task equivalent to maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference and (ii) a minimum graph cutting algorithm can solve this problem in the stock price case in polynomial time. Experimental results show the practicability of our proposed machine learning approach in predicting stock prices. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={Accurate forecasting of directional changes in stock prices is important for algorithmic trading and investment management. Technical analysis has been successfully used in financial forecasting and recently researchers have explored the optimization of parameters for technical indicators. This study investigates the relationship between the window size used for calculating technical indicators and the accuracy of one-step-ahead (variable steps) forecasting. The directions of the future price movements are predicted using technical analysis and machine learning algorithms. Results show a correlation between window size and forecasting step size for the Support Vector Machines approach but not for the other approaches. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Hyper-heuristics have successfully been applied to a vast number of search and optimization problems. One of the novelties of hyper-heuristics is the fact that they manage and automate the meta-heuristic's selection process. In this paper, we implemented and analyzed a hyper-heuristic framework on three meta-heuristics namely Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Guided Local Search, which had successfully been applied in the past to a Financial Forecasting algorithm called EDDIE. EDDIE uses Genetic Programming to extract and learn from historical data in order to predict future financial market movements. Results show that the algorithm's effectiveness has been improved, thus making the combination of meta-heuristics under a hyper-heuristic framework an effective Financial Forecasting approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Forecasting in several areas such as stock price, electricity power consumption, tourist arrival rates or capacity planning allows us to give decisions for future events. The rising up or falling down of the values can support researchers, economists or investors while giving their important decisions. This study aims to forecast the directional movements of electricity load demands and evaluates the performance on 3 load datasets. In experimental results, the proposed Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) based hybrid method is compared with single SVR. It is observed that the proposed EMD-SVR method outperforms the single SVR performance on direction measurements including Direction Accuracy, Correct Up and Correct Down trends. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to investigate empirical evidence of behavioral contagion between oil market, US market and stock markets of oil-importing and oil-exporting countries, during the oil shock and US financial crisis period of 2008-2009, after controlling for fundamentals-driven co-movements. Design/methodology/approach: To examine the volatility spillover among oil market and stock markets, the conditional variance of the trivariate BEKK-GARCH model includes three variables: oil returns, US index returns, and the respective individual market returns of 22 oil-importing and exporting countries. The authors estimate the time-varying correlation coefficients between the prediction error of oil market and each stock index. Also, the authors estimate the time-varying correlation coefficients between the prediction error of US market and each stock index. Findings: The estimation of the trivariate BEKK-GARCH model for VIX, oil market and 23 stock markets of oil-importing and oil-exporting countries suggests the volatility spillover of American investor sentiment to stock market and oil market returns. To capture the pure contagion effects between oil market and stock markets, the authors estimate the forecasting errors of time-varying parameter using the Kalman independently of macroeconomic fundamentals factors. The authors analyze the dynamic correlation between forecasting errors of oil price returns and stock indices returns. The authors show a sharp increase in time-varying correlation coefficients during the oil crisis and US financial crisis period of 2008-2009, which provides strong evidence of herding contagion between oil market and stock markets during the turmoil period. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution in identifying the behavioral contagion between oil market, US market and stock markets of oil-importing and exporting countries especially during the oil shock and US financial crisis period of 2008-2009. Specifically, the authors consider investor sentiment and herding bias to explain the volatility transmission between oil and stock market returns. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Stock Prices are considered to be very dynamic and susceptible to quick changes because of the underlying nature of the financial domain, and in part because of the interchange between known parameters and unknown factors. Of late, several researchers have used Piecewise Linear Representation (PLR) to predict the stock market pricing. However, some improvements are needed to avoid the appropriate threshold of the trading decision, choosing the input index as well as improving the overall performance. In this paper, several techniques of data mining are discussed and applied for predicting price movement. For example, a new technique named Local Saturation Method (LSM) has been used to find the PLR; the weighted moving average has been applied to find recent price moves; the Shannon entropy has been used for measuring the data set complexity or nature; an intelligent system is used to select the new and important technical indexes; and finally, Ensemble Neural Networks (ENN) have been used in order to improve the overall performance. Our method has been tested by thirty problems, including up trade, down trade and steady state features. By applying all those techniques, the proposed algorithm shows good predictions with a hit rate of about 60 percent. © 2014 International Information Institute.},

abstract={Recent innovations in text mining facilitate the use of novel data for sentiment analysis related to financial markets, and promise new approaches to the field of behavioural finance. Traditionally, text mining has allowed a near-real time analysis of available news feeds. The recent dissemination of web 2.0 has seen a drastic increase of user participation, providing comments on websites, social networks and blogs, creating a novel source of rich and personal sentiment data potentially of value to behavioural finance. This study explores the efficacy of using novel sentiment indicators from MarketPsych, which analyses social media in addition to newsfeeds to quantify various levels of individual's emotions, as a predictor for financial time series returns of the Australian Dollar (AUD) - US Dollar (USD) exchange rate. As one of the first studies evaluating both news and social media sentiment indicators as explanatory variables for linear and nonlinear regression algorithms, our study aims to make an original contribution to behavioural finance, combining technical and behavioural aspects of model building. An empirical out-of-sample evaluation with multiple input structures compares multivariate linear regression models (MLR) with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for descriptive modelling. The results indicate that sentiment indicators are explanatory for market movements of exchange rate returns, with nonlinear MLPs showing superior accuracy over linear regression models with a directional out-of-sample accuracy of 60.26% using cross validation. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate prediction of financial time series or their direction of changes may result in highly profitable returns. There are many approaches to build such models. One of them is to apply machine learning algorithms i.e. Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines. In this paper we would like to propose a modified version of Support Vector Machine classifier, Volume Weighted Support Vector Machine which has the ability to predict short term trends on the stock market. Modification is based on the assumption that incorporating transaction volume into penalty function may lead to better future trends forecasting. Experimental results obtained on the data set composed of daily quotations from 420 stocks from S&P500 Index showed that proposed method gives statistically better results than basic algorithm. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={We introduce a novel predictive statistical modeling technique called Hybrid Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (HRBF-NN) as a forecaster. HRBF-NN is a flexible forecasting technique that integrates regression trees, ridge regression, with radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NN). We develop a new computational procedure using model selection based on information-theoretic principles as the fitness function using the genetic algorithm (GA) to carry out subset selection of best predictors. Due to the dynamic and chaotic nature of the underlying stock market process, as is well known, the task of generating economically useful stock market forecasts is difficult, if not impossible. HRBF-NN is well suited for modeling complex non-linear relationships and dependencies between the stock indices. We propose HRBF-NN as our forecaster and a predictive modeling tool to study the daily movements of stock indices. We show numerical examples to determine a predictive relationship between the Istanbul Stock Exchange National 100 Index (ISE100) and seven other international stock market indices. We select the best subset of predictors by minimizing the information complexity (ICOMP) criterion as the fitness function within the GA. Using the best subset of variables we construct out-of-sample forecasts for the ISE100 index to determine the daily directional movements. Our results obtained demonstrate the utility and the flexibility of HRBF-NN as a clever predictive modeling tool for highly dependent and nonlinear data. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Numerous research works have successfully applied the wavelet analysis for the decomposition and forecasting of financial data. Particularly, using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) stock price time series were analyzed following a fixed sub-band coding scheme, which provides a low time resolution for low frequencies and a high time resolution for high frequencies. Following the standard approach found in the literature, only low frequency components were considered as main features to predict stock prices. However, this approach lacks of details about the generative process of the original data. In this paper, we rely on DWT high frequency sub-band to extract short interval hidden information for better classification of future Standard and Poors (S&P500) one minute ahead direction using artificial neural network trained with backpropagation algorithm. The simulation results show that our approach that uses both low (approximation) and high (detail) frequency coefficients provides better classification rates than the standard one. In addition, simulation results show that low frequency components are appropriate to detect future downshifts in S&P500, whilst our approach is suitable to predict future upwards. Thus, the standard approach provides valuable information for risk averse investors trading S&P500, and our approach that combines low and high frequency coefficients is strongly useful for aggressive investors seeking short-term profits when trading S&P500. © World Scientific Publishing Company.},
